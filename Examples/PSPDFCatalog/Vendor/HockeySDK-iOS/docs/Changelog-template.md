## Version 2.5

- General:

	- [NEW] Unified SDK for accessing HockeyApp on iOS

		- Requires iOS 4.0 or newer

		- Replaces the previous separate SDKs for iOS: HockeyKit and QuincyKit.
		
		  The previous SDKs are still available and are still working. But future
		  HockeyApp features will only be integrated in this new unified SDK.

		- Integration either as framework or Xcode subproject using the sourcecode
		
		  Check out [Installation & Setup](Guide-Installation-Setup)

	- [NEW] Cleaned up public interfaces and internal processing all across the SDK

	- [NEW] [AppleDoc](http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/) based documentation and HowTos
	
		This allows the documentation to be generated into HTML or DocSet.

- Crash Reporting:

	- [NEW] Workflow to handle crashes that happen on startup.
	
		Check out [How to handle crashes on startup](HowTo-Handle-Crashes-On-Startup) for more details.

	- [NEW] Symbolicate iOS calls async-safe on the device

	- [NEW] Single property/option to deactivate, require user to agree submitting and autosubmit
		
		E.g. implement a settings screen with the three options and set
		`[BITCrashManager crashManagerStatus]` to the desired user value.

	- [UPDATED] Updated [PLCrashReporter](https://code.google.com/p/plcrashreporter/) with updates and bugfixes (source available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bitstadium/PLCrashReporter))

	- [REMOVED] Feedback for Crash Groups Status
		
		Please keep using QuincyKit for now if you want this feature. This feature needs to be
		redesigned on SDK and server side to be more efficient and easier to use.

- Updating:

	- [NEW] Expire beta versions with a given date

	- [REMOVED] Settings screen

		If you want users to be able not to send analytics data, implement the
		`[BITUpdateManagerDelegate updateManagerShouldSendUsageData:]` delegate and return
		the value depending on what the user defines in your settings UI.
