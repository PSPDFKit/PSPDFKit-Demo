## PSPDFKit v2 - The definitive framework for displaying and annotating PDFs in your iOS apps.

PSPDFKit is a heavily optimized framework for displaying PDF files with horizontal scrolling.
It is fast, flexible, has intelligent caching and renders pages usually faster than iBooks.

*We were impressed on how fast we got a working prototype to show off to the client. Integrating PSPDFKit into our existing project was a breeze and we loved that most of the features we needed for our app were there out of the box. Highly customizable, well documented, great supportâ€¦ this is THE PDF library everyone should use. Money well spent!* -- [Alex Taras, Ruby Tribe.](http://rubytribe.ro/)
