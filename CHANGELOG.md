# Changelog

__v2.1.0 - 17/September/2012__

*  New: PSPDFAESCryptoDataProvider. Allows fast, secure on-the-fly decryption of AES256-secured PDF documents. (PSPDFKit Annotate feature)
   Unlike NSData-based solutons, the PDF never is *fully* decrypted, and this even works with very large (> 100MB) documents.
   Uses 50.000 PBKDF iterations and a custom IV vector for maximum security.
   Includes the AESCryptor helper Mac app to properly encrypt your PDF documents.

*  Allow to customize caching strategy per document with the new cacheStrategy property.
   This is automatically set to PSPDFCacheNothing when using PSPDFAESCryptoDataProvider.
*  Annotations now have a blue selection view when they are selected.
*  Add Black and Red to general annotation color options.
*  Font name/size for FreeText annotations is now parsed.
*  Added write support for FreeText annotations.
*  Allow to show/edit the associated text of highlight annotations.
*  Improves extensibility of the annotation system with adding a isOverlay method to PSPDFAnnotation.
   (Instead of hard-coding this to Link and Note annotations)
*  Moves the clipsToBounds call in PSPDFPageView so that delegate can change this (of UIView <PSPDFAnnotationView>).
*  Adds static helper [PSPDFTextSelectionView isTextSelectionFeatureAvailable] to make runtime checks between PSPDFKit and PSPDFKit Annotate.
*  Adds new isWriteable static method to PSPDFAnnotation subclasses to determine what classes can be written back to PDF.
*  Add kPSPDFAllowAntiAliasing as optional render option.
*  PSPDFOpenInBarButtonItem no longer performs a check for compatible apps. Checking this is pretty slow. An info alert will be displayed to the user if no compatible apps are installed (which is highly unlikely for PDF). You can restore the original behavior with setting kPSPDFCheckIfCompatibleAppsAreInstalled to YES.
*  The viewState is now preserved when another controller is displayed/dismissed modally. This mostly happend with showing/hiding the inline browser or the note text controller on an iPhone. After that the zoom rate was reset; this is now properly preserved.
*  The annotation toolbar now flashes if the user tries to hide the HUD while the bar is still active (and blocking that)
*  Various performance optimizations; especially scrolling and initial controller creation.
*  Removes sporadic vertical transition of the navigationController's navigationBar when HUD faded out.
*  Fixes "Persistent Text Loupe" when moving over a link annotation while selecting.
*  Fixes a memory leak when CGDataProviderRef is used to initialize a PSPDFDocument.
*  Fixes a issue where the UI could sometimes freeze for a while waiting for background tasks in low-memory situations.
*  Fixes a issue where the popover page display wasn't hidden after a rotation.
*  Fixes a issue where sometimes the page was not correctly restored after rotation (was +1).
*  Fixes a issue where, if email wasn't configured on the device, the internal web browser would be launched with a mailto: link. Now a alert is displayed.
*  Fixes a issue where a page could, under certain rare conditions, escape the page tracking and be "sticky" behind the new managed page views.
*  Titanium: Add saveAnnotation method to manually save annotations (needed for createView, automatically called in showPDFAnimated).
*  Titanium: Limit usage of useParentNavigationBar to iOS5 and above.
*  Titanium: fixes a rare condition where using document.password to unlock sometimes resulted in an incorrect value for isLocked.

__v2.0.3 - 14/September/2012__

*  Add a new "renderOptions" property to PSPDFDocument to fine-tune documents (e.g. fixes gray border lines in mostly-black documents)
*  Reduces file size of PSPDFKit.bundle by about 50%; improves speed of certain helper plists parsing.
*  Fixes potential category clashing
*  Fixes a bug that sneeked in because PSPDFKit is now compiled with Xcode 4.5. This release now also works with 4.4 for binary.

__v2.0.2 - 13/September/2012__

*  Support for iPhone 5, Xcode 4.5, armv7s and the new screen resolution.
*  Supports a new cover property to have a custom cover screen for videos (big play button; custom preview-images)
*  Don't show browse popover/actionsheet for multimedia extensions during a long press.
*  Don't allow long-press over a UIControl. (e.g. a UIButton)
*  Fixes a issue where soemtimes multimedia annotations would be added multiple times to the document.
*  Fixes a issue where sometimes you get blank space instead of a page when PSPDFPageRenderingModeFullPageBlocking and PSPDFPageScrollPerPageTransition was combined and the scrobble bar used heavily. This is a workaround for a UIKit bug.
*  Removes libJPGTurbo; Apple's own implementation has gotten faster (especially in iOS6)

__v2.0.1 - 12/September/2012__

*  Faster search (document pattern detection if deplayed until needed, outline results get cached)
*  Improved reaction time for complex PDF documents (e.g. annotations are only evaluated if they're already loaded; but won't lock the main thread due to lazy parsing)
*  Add additional checks so that even incorrectly converted NSURL-paths (where description instead of path has been called) work.
*  Fixes a issue where annotations were not saved with multiple-file documents on all but the first file.
*  Fixes problems where link annotations lost their page/link target after saving annotations into a file.
*  Fixes a problem where fittingWidth was always overridden when run on the iPhone.
*  Fixes a race condition in the new render stack that could lead to an assert in debug mode (non-critical)
*  Fixes the toolbar overlapping text issue in the PSPDFCatalog Kiosk Example; added comments how to work around that UIKit bug.
*  Made the pageRotation property of PSPDFPageInfo writeable; useful for manually rotation PDF documents.
*  Fixes some issues with the Titanium module; adds support for NavigationGroups.
*  Improved memory usage, especially on iPad1.

__v2.0.0 - 08/September/2012__

PSPDFKit v2 is a major updates with lots of changes and a streamlined API.
There are some API deprecations and some breaking changes; but those are fairly straightforward and well documented.

You need at least Xcode 4.4.1 to compile. (Xcode 4.4/4.5 both run fine on Lion, Mountain Lion is not needed but recommended)
PSPDFKit v2 is compatible with iOS 4.3 upwards. (armv7, i386 - thus dropping iOS 4.2/armv6 from v1)

The installation has been simplified. You now just drop the "PSPDFKit.embeddedframework" container into your project.
Next, enable the PSPDFKit.xcconfig project configuration. Here's a screenshot: http://cl.ly/image/1e1I2Z2e1D3F
(Select your project (top left), select project again in the PROJECT/TARGETS tree, select Info, then change in "Based on Configuration file" from None to PSPDFKit.)

If you have the sources and embedd PSPDFKit as a subproject, don't forget to also add PSPDFKit.bundle.


MAJOR NEW FEATURES:
*  Text selection! (PSPDFKit Annotate) (Includes Copy, Dictionary, Wikipedia support)
*  Annotations! (PSPDFKit Annotate) Highlight, Underscore, Strikeout, Note, Draw etc. Annotations also will be written back into the PDF.
   There is a new annptationBarButtonItem that shows the new annotation toolbar.
*  Smart Zoom (Text blocks are detected and zoomed onto on a double-tap; much like Safari)
   The PDF is now also dynamically re-rendered at *every* zoom level for maximal sharpness and quality.
*  Customizable render modes (enable/disable use of upscaled thumbnails). PSPDFPageRenderingModeFullPageBlocking is great for magazines.
*  Greatly improved Search. Faster, parses more font styles, compatible with international characters (chinese, turkish, arabic, ...)
*  Site Bookmarks (see bookmarksBarButtonItem and PSPDFBookmarkParser)
*  Support for VoiceOver accessibility (yes, even within the PDF!)

Further, PSPDFKit has been improved in virtually every area and a lot of details have been tweaked.

*  Inline password view. (Before, just a empty screen was shown when document wasn't unlocked.)
*  Adobe DRM detection (They are just marked as not viewable, instead of showing garbage)
*  PDF rendering indicator. (see pdfController.renderAnimationEnabled)
*  Even better view reuse. PSPDFPageView is now reused, scrolling is even smoother.
*  PSPDFDocument can now be initialized with a CGDataProviderRef or a dataArray.
*  The search/outline controllers now dynamically update their size based on the content height.
*  The Table of Contents/Outline controller now shows titles in multiple lines if too long (this is customizable)
*  Support for Table Of Contents (Outline) linking to external PDF documents.
*  Page Content/Background Color/Inversion can now be changed to modify rendering.
*  On the iPhone, a new documentLabel shows the title. (the navigationBar is too small for this)
*  PSPDFScrobbleBar now uses the small height style on iPhone/Landscape.
*  PSPDFViewController can now programatically invoke a search via searchForString:animated:.
*  PSPDFViewController now has a margin and a padding property to add custom margin/padding on the pdf view.
*  PSPDFViewController now has a HUDViewMode property to fine-tune the HUD.
*  PSPDFTabbedViewController now has a minTabWidth property (defaults to 100)
*  It's now possible to pre-supply even fully-rendered page images. PSPDFDocument's thumbnailPathForPage has been replaced with cachedImageURLForPage:andSize:.
*  PSPDFDocument now has a overrideClassNames dictionary, much like PSPDFViewController.
*  PSPDFDocument now has objectsAtPDFPoint/objectsAtPDFRect to return found glyphs and words.
*  PSPDFDocument now has convenience methods to render PDF content. (renderImageForPage:withSize:.../renderPage:inContext:...)
*  PSPDFDocument now exposes some more common metadata keys for the PDF metadata.
*  PSPDFDocument now has convenience methods to add and get annotations (addAnnotations:forPage:)
*  PSPDFDocument now has a property called annotationSaveMode to switch between PDF annotation embedding or an external file.
*  Support for documents with multiple sources(files/dataArray/documentProvider) is now greatly improved due to the new PSPDFDocument/PSPDFDocumentProvider structure.
*  PSPDFPageView now has convenience methods to calculate between PDF and screen coordinate space (convertViewPointToPDFPoint/convertPDFPointToViewPoint/etc)
*  PSPDFPageView no longer uses CATiledLayer; this has been replaced by a much faster and better custom solution.
*  PSPDFScrollView no longer accepts a tripple-tap for zooming out; this was a rarely-used feature in iOS and it increased the reaction time for the much more used double tap.
   Zooming in/out is now smarter (smart zoom) and does the right thing depending on the zoom position.
*  PSPDFWebViewController now supports printing.
*  A long-press on a PDF link annotation now shows the URL/Document/Page target in a popover.
*  When switching between DEMO/FULL; the change is automatically detected and the cache cleared. (No more watermark problems)
*  The image annotation view now properly displays and animates animated GIFs.
*  GMGridView has been replaced by the new and better PSCollectionView, which is a API compatible copy of UICollectionView.
*  Internal modernization; literals, subscripting, NS_ENUM, NS_OPTIONS.
*  Better internal error handling; more functions have error parameters.

Fixes/API changes:

*  The navigationBar title is no longer set on every page change.
*  PSPDFDocument's PDFDocumentWithUrl has been renamed to PDFDocumentWithURL.
*  Delegates are now called correctly (only once instead of multiple times) in pageCurl mode.
*  pdfViewController:willShowController:embeddedInController:animated: has been changed to (BOOL)pdfViewController:*SHOULD*ShowController:embeddedInController:animated:

*  New delegate: - (void)pdfViewController:(PSPDFViewController *)pdfController didEndPageDragging:(UIScrollView *)scrollView willDecelerate:(BOOL)decelerate withVelocity:(CGPoint)velocity targetContentOffset:(inout CGPoint *)targetContentOffset -> completes dragging delegates; zooming delegates were already available in PSPDFKit v1.
*  Changed willShowController... delegate to shouldShowController... that returns a BOOL.
*  Fixes a problem in the annotation parser where some named page links failed to resolve properly.
*  Fixes a problem where the Cancel button of the additionalBarButtonItem menu wasn't fully touch-able on iPhone.

__v1.10.0 - 25/May/2012__

This will probably be the last major release in the 1.x branch.
Work on 2.x is already underway, with a focus on text selection and annotations.

This release has some API-breaking changes:

* New toolbar handling (breaking API change)
  The properties searchEnabled, outlineEnabled, printEnabled, openInEnabled, viewModeControlVisible
  have been replaced by a much more flexible system based on the PSPDFBarButtonItem class.

  For example, to add those features under the "action" icon as a menu, use this:
  self.additionalRightBarButtonItems = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:self.printButtonItem, self.openInButtonItem, self.emailButtonItem, nil];
  If you're looking to e.g. remove the search feature, set a new rightBarButtonItems array that excludes the searchButtonItem.

  Likewise, the functions additionalLeftToolbarButtons, magazineButton and toolbarBackButton have been unified to self.leftBarButtonItems.
  If you want to replace the default closeButton with your own, just create your own UIBarButtonItem
  and set it to self.leftBarButtonItems = [NSArray arrayWithObject:customCloseBarButtonItem];

* Resolving pdf link paths has changed. (breaking API change)
  Previously, if no marker like "Documents" or "Bundle" was found, we resolved to the bundle.
  This version changes resolving the link to the actual position of the pdf file.
  If you need the old behavior, you can set PSPDFResolvePathNamesEnableLegacyBehavior to YES or use a custom subclass of the PSPDFAnnotationParser.

*  New class PSPDFTabbedViewController, to show multiple PSPDFDocuments with a top tab bar. iOS5 only. (includes new TabbedExample)
*  New feature: PDF page labels are parsed. (e.g. roman letters or custom names; displayed in the PSPDFPositionView and the thumbnail label)
*  New feature: send via Email: allows sending the pdf as an attachment. (see emailButtonItem in PSPDFViewController)
*  New feature: PSPDFViewState allows persisting/restoring of a certain document position (including page, position, zoom level).
   See documentViewState and restoreDocumentViewState:animated: in PSPDFViewController.
*  Add support for puny code characters in pdf URLs (like http://➡.ws/鞰齒). This uses the IDNSDK.
*  New property: useParentNavigationBar, if you embed the PSPDFViewController using iOS5 containment and still want to populate the navigationBar.
*  New property: pageCurlDirectionLeftToRight to allow a backwards pagination. (for LTR oriented documents)
*  New delegate: delegateDidEndZooming:atScale to detect user/animated zooming.
*  UI Improvement: Show URL in embedded browser title bar, until page is loaded with the real title.
*  General: Add french localization in PSPDFKit.bundle.
*  Core: PSPDFDocument now implements NSCopying and NSCoding protocols.
*  Fixes a problem where links with hash bangs (like https://twitter.com/#!/) where incorrectly escaped.
*  Fixes opening certain password protected files.
*  Fixes unlockWithPassword always returning YES, even with an incorrect password.

*  Fixes a problem where the tile wasn't updated after setting document to nil.
*  Fixes a problem where under rare conditions a spinlock wasn't released in PSPDFGlobalLock.
*  Adds support for Xcode 4.4 DP4. Due to an already acknowledged Apple linker bug. Xcode 4.4 DP5 is currently broken. (Xcode 4.3.2 is still recommended)
*  Titanium: New min SDK is 2.0.1.GA2.

__v1.9.15 - 20/Apr/2012__

*  New delegate: pdfViewController:didEndPageScrollingAnimation: to detect if a scroll animation has been finished.
   This will only be called if scrollToPage:animated: is used with animated:YES. (not for manual user scrolling)
*  Additional safeguards have been put in place so that videos don't start playing in the background while scrolling quickly.

__v1.9.14 - 20/Apr/2012__

*  Adds support for Xcode 4.4 DP3.
*  Show document back button even if PSPDFViewController is embedded in a childViewController.

   There is example code in PSPDFExampleViewController.m that shows how this can be combined for dynamic view adaption.
*  Support for Storyboarding! You can create a segway to a PSPDFViewController and even pre-set the document within Interface Builder.
   There now is a new example called "StoryboardExample" that shows how this can be used. (iOS5 only)
*  Note: if you use IB to create the document, you just use a String. Supported path expansions are Documents, Cache, Bundle. Leave blank for Bundle.

*  The incomplete support for text highlighting has been disabled.
*  removeCacheForDocument now has an additional parameter waitUntilDone. The previous behavior was NO,
   so just set NO if you use this and upgrade from an earlier release.
*  Fixes a potential cache-loop, where the device would constantly try to load new images.
*  Adds a sanity check for loading images, fixes a rare issue with images not showing up.

__v1.9.1 - 17/Feb/2012__

*  Allow scrolling to a specific rect and zooming:
   see scrollRectToVisible:(CGRect)rect animated:(BOOL)animated and (void)zoomToRect:(CGRect)rect animated:(BOOL)animated;
*  PSPDFAnnotationParser now allows setting custom annotations. (to complement or override pdf annotations)

*  Renamed kPSPDFKitDebugLogLevel -> kPSPDFLogLevel.

__v1.9.0 - 13/Feb/2012__

*  PageCurl mode. Enable via setting "pageCurlEnabled" to YES. iOS5 only, falls back to scrolling on iOS4.
*  It's now possible to create a PSPDFDocument with initWithData! (thanks to @0xced)

*  Search controller is now auto-dismissed when tapped on a search result.
*  PSPDFPositionView more closely resembles iBooks. (thanks to Chan)
*  PDF cache generation is no no longer stopped in the viewWillDisappear event (only on dealloc, or when document is changed)
*  Titanium: Add ability to hide the close button.

Note: For pageCurl, Apple's UIPageViewController is used. This class is pretty new and still buggy.
I had to apply some private API fixes to make it work. Those calls are obfuscated and AppStore-safe.

If you have any reasons to absolutely don't use those workarounds, you can add
_PSPDFKIT_DONT_USE_OBFUSCATED_PRIVATE_API_ in the preprocessor defines.  (only in the source code variant)
This will also disable the pageCurl feature as the controller will crash pretty fast when my patches are not applied.

Don't worry about this, I have several apps in the store that use such workarounds where needed, it never was a problem.
Also, I reported those bugs to Apple and will keep track of the fixes,
and remove my workarounds for newer iOS versions if they fix the problem.


__v1.8.4 - 27/Dec/2011__

*  Fixes a problem where search highlights were not displayed.
*  Updated git version scripts to better work with branches. (git rev-list instead of git log)

__v1.8.3 - 26/Dec/2011__

*  Update internally used TTTAttributedString to PSPDFAttributedString; prevent naming conflicts.
*  Fallback to pdf filename if pdf title is set but empty.
*  pageMode can now be set while willAnimateRotationToInterfaceOrientation to customize single/double side switching.
*  Fixes a problem with the document disappearing in certain low memory situations.

__v1.8.2 - 25/Dec/2011__

*  Uses better image pre-caching code; now optimizes for RGB screen alignment; smoother scrolling!
*  Fixes a regression with scrobble bar hiding after animation.
*  Fixes wrong toolbar offset calculation on iPad in landscape mode.
*  Various performance optimizations regarding CGPDFDocument, HUD updates, thumbnails, cache creation.
*  Lazy loading of thumbnails.

__v1.8.1 - 23/Dec/2011__

*  UINavigationBar style is now restored when PSPDFViewController is popped back.
*  Annotation page cache is reset when protocol is changed.
*  Fixes Xcode Archive problem because of public header files in PSPDFKit-lib.xcodeproj
*  Fixes a regression with the Web-AlertView-action not working.

__v1.8.0 - 21/Dec/2011__

*  Search Highlighting! This feature is still in BETA, but already works with many documents. If it doesn't work for you, you can disable it with changing the searchMode-property in PSPDFDocumentSearcher. We're working hard to improve this, it just will take some more time until it works on every document. As a bonus, search is now fully async and no longer blocks the main thread.

*  ARC! PSPDFKit now internally uses ARC, which gives a nice performance boost and makes the codebase a lot cleaner. PSPDFKit is still fully compatible with iOS4 upwards. You need to manually include libarclite.so if you are not using ARC and need compatibility with iOS4. Check the MinimalExample.xcodeproj to see how it's done. (You can drag the two libarclite-libraries directly in your project). If you use the PSPDFKit-lib.xcodeproj as a submodule, you don't have to think about this, Xcode is clever enough to not expose this bug here. See more about this at http://pspdfkit.com/documentation.html.

*  New default shadow for pages. More square, iBooks-like. The previous shadow is available when changing shadowStyle in PSPDFScrollView. The shadow override function has been renamed to pathShadowForView.
*  New: PSPDFDocument now uses the title set in the pdf as default. Use setTitle to set your own title. Title is now also thread-safe.
*  New Thumbnail-Framework (removed AQGridView). Faster, better animations, allows more options. Thumbnails are now centered. You can override this behavior with subclassing gridView in PSPDFViewController.
*  New: HUD-elements are now within hudView, hudView is now a PSPDFHUDView, lazily created.
*  New: Page position is now displayed like in iBooks at the bottom page (title is now just title)
*  Changed: Videos don't auto play per default. Change the url to pspdfkit[autoplay:true]://devimages.apple.com/iphone/samples/bipbop/bipbopall.m3u8 to restore the old behavior (or use delegates).
*  Changed: viewMode does not longer animate per default. Use the new setViewMode:animated: to change it with animation.
*  Changed: the left section of the toolbar now uses iOS5-style leftToolBarButtons if available; falls back to custom UIToolBar in iOS4.
*  Shortly pressed link targets are now highlighted with a minimum duration.
*  Alert is no longer displayed for URLs that can't be opened by the system.
*  Support detection of "m4v" as video annotation.
*  Improves performance when caching very large documents.
*  Expose the borderColor of PSPDFLinkAnnotationView; set in one of the delegates.
*  Removes a lot of glue code and switches to KVO for many view-related classes (Scrobble Bar)
*  Add methods to check if PSPDFPageInfo is already available, improves thumbnail speed.
*  Add generic support to override classes. See the property "overrideClassNames" for details. This replaces "scrollViewClass" and "scrobbleBarClass" and is much more flexible. Just use a key/value pair of NSStrings with default/new class names and your custom subclass will be loaded.
*  setScrobbleBarEnabled is now animatable.
*  The protocolString for the multimedia link annotation additions can now be set in PSPDFAnnotationParser (defaults to pspdfkit://).
*  didTapOnPage is now didTapOnPageView, the former is deprecated.
*  PSPDFPageCoordinates now show a nice description when printed.
*  Many deprecated delegate calls have been removed. Check your calls.
*  Version number is now directly written from the git repository. (PSPDFVersionString() is now more accurate)
*  When a link annotation is tapped, the HUD no longer shows/hides itself.
*  HUD show/hide is now instant, as soon as scrolling is started. No more delays.
*  Scrollbar is now only changed if controller is displayed in full-screen (non-embedded).
*  Fixes a issue where PSPDFKit would never release an object if annotations were disabled.
*  Fixes a bug where the outline was calculated too often.
*  Fixes an issue where the title was re-set when changing the file of a pdf.
*  Fixes problems with syntax highlighting of some files. Xcode 4.3 works even better; use the beta if you can.
*  Fixes a bug with video player when auto play is not enabled.
*  Fixes encoding for mailto: URL handler (%20 spaces and other encoded characters are now properly decoded)
*  Fixes potential crash with recursive calls to scrollViewDidScroll.
*  Fixes a rare crash when delegates are changed while being enumerated.
*  Lots of other small improvements.

__v1.7.5 - 01/Dec/2011__

*  Fixes calling the deprecated delegate didShowPage when didShowPageView is not implemented. (thanks Albin)

__v1.7.4 - 29/Nov/2011__

*  Custom lookup for parent viewcontroller - allows more setups of embedded views.
*  Fixes a crash related to parsing table of contents.

__v1.7.3 - 29/Nov/2011__

*  Add a log warning that the movie/audio example can crash in the Simulator. Known Apple bug. Doesn't happen on the device.
*  PSPDFCache can now be subclassed. Use kPSPDFCacheClassName to set the name of your custom subclass.
*  Fixes a bug where scrollingEnabled was re-enabled after a zoom operation.

__v1.7.2 - 29/Nov/2011__

*  Changes delegates to return PSPDFView instead of the page: didShowPageView, didRenderPageView.
*  Improve zoom sharpness. (kPSPDFKitZoomLevels is now set to 5 per default from 4; set back if you experience any memory problems on really big documents.)
*  Increase tiling size on iPad1/older devices to render faster.
*  Reduce loading of unneeded pages. Previously happened sometimes after fast scrolling. This also helps when working with delegates.
*  Fixes a locking race condition when using PSPDFDocument.twoStepRenderingEnabled.

__v1.7.1 - 29/Nov/2011__

*  Fixes a rare crash when encountering non-standardized elements while parsing the Table of Contents.

__v1.7.0 - 28/Nov/2011__

*  PSPDFKit now needs at least Xcode 4.2/Clang 3.0 to compile.
*  Following new frameworks are required: libz.dylib, ImageIO.framework, CoreMedia.framework, MediaPlayer.framework, AVFoundation.framework.
*  Images are now compressed with JPG. (which is usually faster) If you upgrade, add an initial call to [[PSPDFCache sharedPSPDFCache] clearCache] to remove the png cache. You can control this new behavior or switch back to PNGs with PSPDFCache's useJPGFormat property.
*  Optionally, when using PNG as cache format, crushing can be enabled, which is slower at writing, but faster at reading later on. (usually a good idea!)

*  New multimedia features! Video can now be easily embedded with a custom pspdfkit:// url in link annotations. Those can be created with Mac Preview.app or Adobe Acrobat. Try for example "pspdfkit://devimages.apple.com/iphone/samples/bipbop/bipbopall.m3u8" to get the HTTP Live streaming test video.

*  Link annotations are now UIButtons. This allows more interactivity (feedback on touch down), and also changes the default implementation of PSPDFDocument's drawAnnotations function to be empty. Clear the cache after updating, or else you get two borders. You can also return to the old behavior if you return NO on shouldDisplayAnnotation (PSPDFViewControllerDelegate) anytime an annotation of type PSPDFAnnotationTypeLink is sent.

*  Localization is now handled via the PSPDFKit.bundle. You can either change this, or use PSPDFSetLocalizationDictionary to add custom localization.

*  PSPDFLinkAnnotation is renamed to PSPDFAnnotation and adds a new helper function to get the annotation rect.
*  PSPDFPage is refactored to PSPDFPageView and is now the per-page container for a document page. The delegate methods have been changed to return the corresponding PSPDFPageView. Within PSPDFPageView, you can get the parent scrollview PSPDFScrollView.
*  PSPDFPageModeAutomatic is now more intelligent and only uses dual page mode if it actually improves reading (e.g. no more dual pages on a landscape-oriented document)
*  PSPDFKitExample: fixes delete-image positioning in long scroll lists.
*  new: use PSPDFPageInfo everywhere to allow custom rotation override. (- (PSPDFPageInfo *)pageInfoForPage:(NSUInteger)page pageRef:(CGPDFPageRef)pageRef)
*  new delegate options to allow dynamic annotation creation.
*  Better size calculation for the toolbar, allows changing titles to longer/shorter words and resizing automatically.
*  PSPDFDocument now uses the title of the pdf document (if available). You can override this with manually setting a title.
*  New option "scrollingEnabled" to be able to lock scrolling. (e.g. when remote controlling the pdf)
*  Improves speed on image pre-caching.
*  Improves documentation.
*  Fixes a rotation problem with the last magazine page.
*  Fixes a bug where scrollPage w/o animation didn't show the page until the user scrolled.
*  Fixes a potential crash when view was deallocated while popover was opened.
*  Fixes a deadlock with clearCache.

__v1.6.20 - 18/Nov/2011__

*  fixes possible cache-reload loop with page-preload if non-odd values are chosen.
*  fixes a memory leak (regression in 1.6.18)

__v1.6.19 - 16/Nov/2011__

*  further small rotation improvement.

__v1.6.18 - 16/Nov/2011__

*  New: Much, much improved rotation. Now smooth as butter. Enjoy!

__v1.6.17 - 12/Nov/2011__

*  In search results, "Site" was renamed to "Page" to be consistent with the toolbar. If you use custom localization, you have to rename the entry "Site %d" to "Page %d".
*  add API call to allow basic text extraction from the search module (magazine.documentSearcher)

__v1.6.16 - 12/Nov/2011__

*  fixes a bug with invalid caching entries when a deleted document is re-downloaded in the same application session (pages suddenly went black)
*  add a custom lib-project for PSPDFKit; it's now easier than ever to integrate it. Note: you really should use that one - I'll switch over to ARC soon, so a library makes things easier.

__v1.6.15 - 05/Nov/2011__

*  thumbnails are now displayed under the transparent bar, not overlapping
*  only enable outline if it's enabled and there actually is an outline (no more empty popovers)
*  mail links are now presented in a form sheet on the iPad
*  allow show/hide of navigation bar even when zoomed in

__v1.6.14 - 22/Oct/2011__

*  fixes bug where delete method of PSPDFCache (removeCacheForDocument) was deleting the whole directory of the pdf instead of just the related files

__v1.6.13 - 22/Oct/2011__

*  removed the zeroing weak reference helper. If you use custom delegates for PSPDFCache, you now need to manually deregister them. Upside: better management of delegates.

__v1.6.12 - 19/Oct/2011__

*  changed: turns out, when compiling with Xcode 4.2/Clang, you'll loose binary compatibility with objects linked from 4.1. Thus, the framework crashed with EXC_ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION when compiled within an older Xcode. I will use 4.1 some more time to give everyone the change to upgrade, but due to some *great* improvements in Clang 3.0 compiler that ships with Xcode 4.2 (e.g. nilling out of structs accessed from a nil object) it's highly advised that you use Xcode 4.2. If you use the source code directly, this is not an issue at all.

__v1.6.11 - 14/Oct/2011__

*  new: PSPDFKit is now compiled with Xcode 4.2/iOS Base SDK 5.0 (still works with 4.x)
*  improves compatibility for outline parser; now able to handle rare array/dict destination variants (fixes all destinations = page 1 error)
*  fixes a rare stack overflow when re-using zoomed scrollviews while scrolling.
*  fixes a compile problem on older Xcode versions. (It's not officially supported though - use Xcode 4.2 for the best experience!)
*  fixes a memory problem where iPad1 rarely tries to repaint a page forever

__v1.6.10 - 25/Sept/2011__

*  aspectRatioEqual now defaults to NO. Many customers oversee this and then send me (false) bug reports. Set this to YES for maximum speed if your document has one single aspect ratio (like most magazines should).
*  scroll to active page in grid view
*  fixes small offset-error in the scrobble bar

__v1.6.9 - 22/Sept/2011__

*  add option do debug memory usage (Instruments isn't always great)
*  improves memory efficiency on tile drawing, animations
*  improves performance, lazily creates gridView when first accessed
*  improves scrobble bar update performance
*  fixes memory problems on older devices like iPad 1, iPhone 3GS

*  fixes positioning problem using the (unsupported) combination of PSPDFScrollingVertical and fitWidth

__v1.6.5 - 15/Sept/2011__

*  fixes a bug where scroll position was remembered between pages when using fitWidth

__v1.6.4 - 15/Sept/2011__

*  new: didRenderPage-delegate
*  fixes: crash bug with NaN when started in landscape

__v1.6.3 - 14/Sept/2011__

*  new: maximumZoomScale-property is exposed in PSPDFViewController
*  changed: *realPage* is now remembered, not the page used in the UIScrollView. This fixes some problems with wrong page numbers.
*  fixes situation where page was changed to wrong value after view disappeared, rotated, and reappeared.
*  fixes option button in example is now touchable again
*  fixes a bug where HUD was never displayed again when rotating while a popover controller was visible
*  fixes potential crash where frame get calculated to NaN, leading to a crash on view rotation
*  fixes problems when compiling with GCC. You really should use LLVM/Clang though.

__v1.6.2 - 13/Sept/2011__

*  fixed: HUD is now black again on disabled status bar

__v1.6.1 - 13/Sept/2011__

*  new: open email sheet per default when detecting mailto: annotation links. (You now need the MessageUI.framework!)
*  new: fileUrl property in PSPDFDocument
*  improve toolbar behavior when setting status bar to default
*  fixes memory related crash on older devices
*  fixes crash when toolbarBackButton is nil
*  greatly improved KioskExample


__v1.6.0 - 12/Sept/2011__

*  changed: willShowPage is now deprecated, use didShowPage. Both now change page when page is 51% visible. Former behavior was leftIndex
