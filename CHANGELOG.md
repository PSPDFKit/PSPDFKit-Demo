__v2.7.3 - 20/January/2013__

*  FreeText annotations are now editable inline.
*  Improves stamp and signature rect placement (no longer places the rect outside of page boundaries)
*  Drawing overlay is now transparent. You can restore this behavior with subclassing PSPDFDrawView and setting the backgroundColor to [UIColor colorWithWhite:1.0 alpha:0.5].
*  When chaning the thickness of a drawing, the selection border will now automatically adapt itself to fit the new bounds.
*  Renamed "Colors..." menu entry to "Color...".
*  Fixes a potential issue with annotation rotation handling.
*  Fixes a potential crash on stamp creation on iPhone.
*  Fixes an issue where the drawing toolbar was added behind the HUD toolbar.
*  Fixes an issue where PSPDFKit could end up displaying something like 'Page 2-3 of 2'.
*  Fixes an issue where certain pages could be skipped with scroll to prev/nextPage in double page mode (via touching the borders).
*  Fixes some typos and spelling mistakes.

__v2.7.2 - 18/January/2013__

*  PSPDFScrollView will now move up if a keyboard is displayed.
*  Free Text annotation now have sensible defaults when created in code. (Helvetica, font-size 20)
*  Several tweaks for PSPDFProcessor PDF from web/office files generation.
*  Fixes a potential crash in the iPhone popover controller.
*  Fixes in the annotation selection handling logic.
*  Fixes a minor UX issue where Open In... could result in a second tap needed to activate.

__v2.7.1 - 17/January/2013__

*  Note annotation flattening.
*  Text selection is now always priorized over image selection.
*  For the continuous scrolling page transition, all visible pages are now animated when showing/hiding the thumbnail view.
*  Improve PDF serialization of custom stamp annotations.
*  Fixes an animation issue with continuous scrolling.
*  Fixes an UI issue where under certain conditions a second tap was required on a toolbar button to hide the active popover.
*  Fixes an UI issue with creating note annotations.
*  Fixes an issue where annotation resizing was disabled when textSelectionEnabled was set to NO.
*  Fixes a rounding bug in continuous scrolling that could lead to a x AND y scrolling on zoomScale 1.0
*  Fixes several issues with certain RichMedia embedded video annotations.

__v2.7.0 - 16/January/2013__

*  PSPDFKit model classes now have a common base model class 'PSPDFModel' - allows to serialize/deserialize via JSON easily using externalRepresentationInFormat:.
   To get the JSON dictionary, use annotation externalRepresentationInFormat:PSPDFModelJSONFormat.
   (The old annotation serialization format is still supported for the time being)
*  PSPDFKit now requires AssetsLibrary.framework - if you're using PSPDFKit.xcproj or the source distribution, this is already been taken cared of. If you added the frameworks manually and get a linker error, make sure you are linking sAssetsLibrary.framework.
*  PSPDFMenuItem learned to show images in UIMenuController - this beautifies many of the annotation menus, images are now used for annotation types/colors where appropriate.
*  PSPDFKit has learned to write apperance streams. Currently they are emitted for Stamp and Ink annotations. This will help to further improve annotation compatibility with some apps that behave less standard compliant (like Adobe Acrobat/iOS, last tested version is 10.4.4, which doesn't show Ink annotations if they do not have an attached AP stream, even if this is invalid behavior according to the PDF spec. (GoodReader/Preview.app/Adobe Reader on the Mac don't require an AP stream and work in compliance to the spec.))
*  Annotation menus have been cleaned up a little, Opacity... has been moved into a submenu of Color for highlight annotations.
*  PSPDFProcessor has learned to write annotations as dictionary, not only flatten. This will be used e.g. for Open In... when the original PDF is not writeable and thus annotations are saved in an external file.
*  Open In... will now create a new file if there are annotations and the source PDF is not writeable itself.
*  Stamp annotations now have limited support for appearance streams.
*  Stamp annotations can now be added via the new PSPDFStampViewController.
*  Add experimental pageRange feature in PSPDFDocument to allow showing of a subset of the pages.
*  Highlight annotation hit testing is now more accurate, checking the specific rects of the highlights, not the outer boundingBox.
*  Annotation rendering now checks if the annotation will be visible at all and only then renders the annotation. This speeds up zooming on complex documents with many annotations.
*  Improves search by ignoring certain whitespace characters like no-break-spaces.
*  Allows to create password protected PDFs with PSPDFProcessor up to AES-128 (and mix other CGPDFContext properties like kCGPDFContextAllowsPrinting or kCGPDFContextAllowsCopying)
*  Improves word detection with splitting words between a line of thought and adding special logic for non-default whitespace characters.
to use the old behavior.
*  Improves french translation.
*  zIndex of annotation images is now below zIndex of links, so that links are always displayed before annotation images.
*  Email sending using PSPDFEmailSendMergedFilesIfNeeded will not perform a merge if there is only one source document.
*  Links are now handled even if they are overlapped or hidden underneath other views.
*  Hides the page label and the scrobble bar if the document is password protected and not yet unlocked.
*  PSPDFAnnotation now shows if an appearanceStream is attached.
*  PSPDFAnnotation now as a userInfo dictionary to add any custom data.
*  Annotations now have a creationDate.
*  When note annotations are tapped, don't fade-animate the former annotation out.
*  Page label will not be displayed if the page label is simply the real page number. (Prevent titles like 2 (2 of 10))
*  The internal web browser will now display an error within the HTML, much like Safari on iOS: https://twitter.com/steipete/status/287272056524001280
*  Selected images now have a (default iOS light blue) selection state, matching the selection behavior of glyphs.
*  Brightness control now has indicator images for less/more brightness and a better icon.
*  Improves performance for pages with many links by dynamically disabling the rounded corners in that case.
*  External PDF links can now be opened modally in a new controller, use [modal:YES] in the option field, e.g. pspdfkit://[modal:YES]localhost/two.pdf#page=4.
*  Video extension with a cover now no longer has a dark background and is transparent. If you set cover:YES it will simply show the play button without any background.
*  API change: Words are now detected if they are completely within the rect specified. Use kPSPDFObjectsTestIntersection
*  API change: OutlineElement.page is now 0-based, not 1-based.
*  API change: Several PSPDFProcessor methods now have an additional error part.
*  API change: PSPDFInkAnnotation has been simplified, will automatically recalculate bounding box and paths on line change.
*  API change: Setting the annotation color will now also set the alpha value, if one is set in color.
*  API change: objectsAtPoint: now automatically does an intersection test unless specified otherwise, but objectsAtRect will not, so you need to specify that. Also, in previous version the rect check was done incorrectly to check if the test rect is within the object, now we check if the object is within the test rect OR intersects with it, if intersection is set to YES.
*  API change: Links to external files now reference the page, not page+1. (pspdfkit://localhost/two.pdf#page=4 will move to page 4, before it was page 5)
*  Add support for older PDF standard of defining Dest arrays for page links (for example those produced by LaTeX with PDF version 1.3)
*  Annotation option parsing is now more robust and will tolerate whitespace.
*  Annotation text (and thus the annotation menu) is now even displayed if editableAnnotationType is set to NO.
*  Adds a workaround for certain PDFs with large embedded videos that previously couldn't be parsed.
*  PSPDFKit now uses OS_OBJECT_USE_OBJC instead of OS version checking to check of GCD objects are collected via ARC or not (This is iOS6 only and the new default, can be disabled by the compiler)
*  Text in the password view is now viewable on iPhone in landscape.
*  Fixes an issue with font caching on search and certain documents.
*  Fixes an off-by-one error on writing link annotations that link to internal pages.
*  Fixes an issue with the "Save To Camera Roll" feature and iOS6 - the required rights are now checked fore before writing the image, and an error dialog is displayed for the user in case image saving failed.
*  Fixes an issue where PDF images in CMYK format could not be saved to the Camera Roll.
*  Fixes an issue where PSPDFTabbedViewController failed to show the tab bar if restoreState wasn't called and thus the documents array was nil.
*  Fixes an issue with opening internal html links on PDF link annotations on the device (worked fine on the Simulator)
*  Fixes an issue where the cancel button of the search controller was disabled sometimes (iPhone only)
*  Fixes an issue where under certain conditions link annotations were marked as dirty right after reading them from the PDF which could result in some slowdown when hiding the PSPDFViewController.
*  Fixes a crash with LifeScribe PDF documents when there's an embedded video annotation.
*  Fixes a weird potential crashing issue where setting the controlStyle of the MPMoviePlayerController could throw an exception (which is not documented and should not happen according to the MPMoviePlayer documentation).
*  Fixes a bug that prevented setting of the defaultColorPickerStyles.
*  Fixes an issue where the cover view of movie annotations showed outdated content in some cases.
*  Fixes a potential stack overflow when a PDF that had recursive XObjects with font informations was parsed.
*  Fixes an UIKit bug where the statusbar sometimes was placed above the navigationBar on certain occasions.
*  Fixes issue where certain isOverlay=YES annotations became unmovable after a save until the page had been changed.

*  Fixes an issue where encryptImage:fromDocument: wasn't actually using the encrypted data.
*  Fixes an issue in the text extractor with parsing certain special formatted CMaps wit bfranges. This should especially help for text extraction errors in languages like turkish or chinese.
*  Fixes a missing setter for PSPDFLineAnnotation.
*  Fixes a retain cycle with PSPDFAnnotationToolbar because the delegate was retained.
*  Fixes a issue with AES-128 encrypted documents that failed to open with a "failed to create default crypt filter." error.
*  Fixes the delegate in the PSCAnnotationTestController (thanks to Peter Li)

*  Titanium: Fixes issue with the didTapOnAnnotation callback and event.

__v2.6.3 - 17/December/2012__

*  Allows subclassing of PSPDFThumbnailGridViewCell via overrideClassNames.
*  Uses the shared alpha property for fillColor, to be compliant to the PDF standard. (mostly affects shape annotations)
*  Ensure annotation selection is cleared before a pageCurl transition starts.

__v2.5.2 - 22/November/2012__

*  New convenience helper: setUpdateSettingsForRotationBlock in PSPDFViewController. (e.g. to switch between pageCurl and scrolling on rotation)
*  Moves the logic that returns the default classes for supported annotations out of PSPDFFileAnnotationProvider into PSPDFAnnotationProvider - so if the annotationProvider is customized to use only custom annotation providers, annotations will still work.
*  Handles corrupt PDF more gracefully, failing faster (esp. important if you're using a custom CGDataProvider)
*  Search no longer searches between words (but between lines)
*  API: Renamed fixedVerticalPositionForfitToWidthEnabledMode to fixedVerticalPositionForFitToWidthEnabledMode.

*  Fixes an issue where the text block detection could take a very long time on some documents.
*  Fixes an issue where a log warning was displayed when a highlight annotation was loaded from disk.

*  Fixes an issue with text encoding on some PDFs.

__v2.5.0 - 17/November/2012__

*  Images can now be selected and copied to the clipboard or saved to the camera roll. There's a new delegate to customize this.
*  A long-press on an annotation will switch over to edit-mode. Either moving if allowed, or showing the menu and cancelling the gesture if not.
*  Changes the default PDF Box back to kCGPDFCropBox. You can customize this with using the "PDFBox" property on PSPDFDocument.
*  Annotations can now be moved and resized, and the selection view is much sexier now (matches popular iOS apps like Pages)
*  Words are highlighted as they are being highlighted using the annotation toolbar.
*  Update color picker to include more colors and for better use space on iPhone 5 and iPad.
*  Default drawing color is now blue.
*  Highlight annotation color menu will now no longer show the currently used color and has a new option "Custom..." that will show the default color picker.
*  The options in PSPDFEmailBarButtonItem have been changed to a bit field, it's more flexible now. The flattenedAnnotations parameter is gone and is is now a subset of the bit field.
*  Annotation toolbar has now properties expoed for easy drawing color/width change.
*  Add initial implementation for stamp annotations (text and images are supported, no complex AP streams)
*  Support for "Named" PDF link annotations. (like NextPage/PrevPage/FirstPage/LastPage)
*  Add "Key" image for note annotations.
*  Add support for dashed borders on various annotation types.
*  PSPDFPageLabelView how shows a custom label for double page mode that displays all visible pages, not only the first. (2-3 of 42) instead of (2 of 42).
*  Refactoring of the search subsystem. Some methods have been renamed/deprecated. The interface is now much cleaner.
*  Search now search pages in the natural order, no longer visible pages first. You can revert this behavior change with setting searchVisiblePagesFirst to YES in PSPDFSearchViewController.
*  Search now also finds words that are split up via newline and/or a hyphenations character. This is enabled by default. See PSPDFTextSearch.compareOptions.
*  PSPDFSearchResult now has a PSPDFTextBlock as selection type (because it mighy have words on multiple lines). PSPDFSearchHighlightView now supports highlighting of multiple words.
*  Search now is more tolerant on single/double quotation marks.
*  Improves annotation toolbar animation for iPhone/landscape.
*  PSPDFHighlightAnnotation has a new helper "highlightedString" to get the string value of the highlighted area. Here, the document content is evaluated, since the annotation just contains CGRect values.
*  The annotation toolbar now remembers all last used colors per annotation type IF they are changed while the annotation toolbar is visible. (e.g. create yellow highlights, change annotation color to red, make new highlights -> red. But if you change color at a point where the annotation toolbar is closed, the color will not be remembered.)
*  PSPDFGlyph/PSPDFWord/PSPDFTextBlock frame now needs to be converted using the convertViewRectToGlyphRect/convertGlyphRectToViewRect to get the correct results.
*  New helper: PSPDFBezierPathGetPoints to convert UIBezierPaths into the representation needed in PSPDFInkAnnotation.
*  Adds some missing annotation change events.
*  A visible annotation toolbar will be removed when the viewController disappears.
*  Improved the performance of outline parsing and animation.
*  New HUD mode: PSPDFHUDViewAutomaticNoFirstLastPage - similar to PSPDFHUDViewAutomatic but doesn't show the HUD on the first/last page automatically.
*  Delegate didRenderPage:inContext: is now only called for current rendering. (not manual calls or cache)
*  PSPDFAnnotationToolbar now exposes cancelDrawingAnimated/doneDrawingAnimated to manually cancel/confirm a open drawing.
*  PSPDFSearchBarButtonItem, PSPDFOutlineBarButtonItem, PSPDFViewModeBarButtonItem can now also be overridden using overrideClassNames.
*  PSPDFOutlineParsers's isOutlineAvailable now parses the outline and always returns the correct value.
*  If the keyboard whas displayed on a PDF password prompt, that is now hidden again after the viewController is removed from the view.
*  A single paged document is now displayed centered on pageCurl transition mode (instead of right-aligned)
*  Adds the iPod touch (4G) to the list of old devices, because that one has Retina but only 256MB RAM.
*  Allows click-through selection of annotations that are on different pages. (before, you needed sometimes one extra-touch to hide the current selection)
*  PSPDFGlyph, PSPDFWord, PSPDFTextLine and PSPDFTextBlock can now be properly compared using isEqual.
*  The text selection is now hidden before the callout menu hides, not afterwards (to match default iOS behavior)
*  On the Thickness... menu, the option that is currently active is hidden.
*  The link selection touch-down gray is now less dark to better match Apple's default look.
*  The tinted popover background is now retina optimized and no longer draws an arrow outside of the rounded corner area.
*  Fixes a potential stack overflow when parsing really large PDF outlines (>3000 items).
*  Fixes an UI issue where the annotation toolbar active mode overlay wasn't updated on an annotation frame change.
*  Fixes an UI bug where note annotations could show with an outdated view (e.g. no color cange visible on page change)

*  Fixes some settings where didLoadPageView: was not called anymore.
*  Fixes a rare UIKit crash in UIPageViewController by adding a workaround.
*  Fixes a potential crash when hot-swapping the document from/to a 1-page document while using UIPageViewController in dual page mode.
*  Fixes an issue where the text selection menu sometimes wasn't correctly displayed on the right site of a zoomed in page in pageCurl mode.
*  Fixes a potential crash when a document was hot-swapped during a render operation.
*  Fixes a rare rendering issue with certain PDF documents that have weird rotation values.
*  Fixes an issue with the CMap parser where the second part of font ligatures was ignored. (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_ligature for details)
*  Fixes PSPDFProcessor's output of generatePDFFromDocument on rotated PDFs (documents had white border).
*  Fixes a issue where parsed text coordinates were offset on some non-standard PDFs that had both rotation and a non-null CropBox origin.

KNOWN ISSUE: Annotations can't yet be moved *between* pages. This feature is on our roadmap.

__v2.4.0 - 2/November/2012__

PSPDFKit now requires iOS 5.0+ and Xcode 4.5+ (iOS SDK 6.0) to compile. (Support for iOS 4.3/Xcode 4.4 has been removed, support for iOS 6.1 and Xcode 4.6b1 has been added.)

2.4 is a big release and a great new milestone of PSPDFKit. If you upgrade, make sure to read through the full header diffs to make sure methods you were calling/overriding still exist and are not moved.
Common methods like pageScrolling will always get a compatibility method for the time being. Methods/Properties are are deeper within the framework won't get a compatibility method, but it's usually pretty easy to figure out what the propert was named before. I am planning on working on PSPDFKit for a long time, and as the API evolves, it's sometimes necessary to clean up and rename things so that the API stays clean and logical.

*  Huge refactoring of PSPDFAnnotationParser. It's now much easier to add custom annotation providers (see PSPDFAnnotationProvider). If you have sublcassed saving/loading or other parts of PSPDFAnnotationParser, you most likely need to change this over to the new PSPDFFileAnnotationProvider.
*  Page scrolling is now even smoother. And finally removes the slight stuttering when pushing the PSPDFViewController - now animates like butter.
*  PSPDFShapeAnnotation can now be saved into the PDF.
*  Ink drawings can now customize the Thickness. Select an annotation and use the new "Thickness..." menu item.
*  Ink drawings and shape annotations can now also contain comment text.
*  Annotations now support the title/user "T" flag. Change the default user name by changing the property in PSPDFFileAnnotationProvider.
*  Add support for embedded and external RichMedia and Screen (Video) annotations of any size.
*  PSPDFBarButtonItem now has longPress-support. Long-Press on the bookmarkBarButtonItem to see the new PSPDFBookmarkViewController. Bookmarks can now also be renamed/reordered.
*  If there's no searchButton visible, the search invoked from the text selection menu now will originate from the selection rect.
*  The Open In... action now also works on multi-file documents and/or data/cgdocumentprovider based documents (will merge the document on-the-fly, shows a progress window if it'll take some time)
*  PSPDFBarButtonItem now also accepts a generic UIView as sender on presentAnimated:sender:. (makes it easier to manually call menu items from custom code)
*  Better support when barButtonItems are added to custom UIToolbars.
*  The internal used BarButtonItem subclasses are now exposed, so that they can be overridden and their icon changed.
*  New activityBarButtonItem to share pages to Facebook/Twitter on iOS6.
*  Double-Tapping on a video now enables full-screen (instead of zooming the page. This does not apply to YouTube movies)
*  Greatly improves handling of multiple video views on one page/screen.
*  Annotation views now have a optional xIndex. Video has a high index by default, so link annotations won't overlap a video anymore.
*  No longer allowing text selection above video annotations.
*  PSPDFDocument now has a new property 'PDFBox' to customize the used PDF box (ClipRect/MediaRect/etc).
*  PSPDFPositionView has been renamed to PSPDFPageLabelView. PSPDFPageLabelView and PSPDFDocumentLabelView are now easier skinable with the common superclass PSPDFLabelView.
*  PSPDFLabelView has now a second predefined style (PSPDFLabelStyleBordered)
*  PSPDFPageLabelView can now show a toolbar item. Check out the "Settings for a magazine" example how to enable this.
*  PSPDFLinkAnnotationView and the other multimedia annotation views can now be subclassed via overrideClassNames.
*  The Edit button for the text editor on note annotations can now be hidden. (showColorAndIconOptions)
*  UI: Moved the Edit button of the PSPDFNoteAnnotationController to the left side. (only visible for PSPDFNoteAnnotation)
*  Improves annotation parsing speed.
*  Shape/Circle annotations now correctly display their fillColor.
*  Improved color parsing for PSPDFFreeTextAnnotation (now honoring the default style string setting)
*  The icons in the viewModeBarButtonItem now have the same shadow as the toolbar icons (iPhone for now).
*  No longer displays annotation menus when they can't be saved (PSPDFKit Basic)
*  Expose outlineIntentLeftOffset and outlineIndentMultiplicator as properties on PSPDFOutlineViewController and PSPDFOutlineCell.
*  Exposes firstLineRect, lastLineRect and selectionRect on PSPDFTextSelectionView.
*  The text loupe now fades our correctly when in drag-handle-mode.
*  Improved caching of external resources like annotations/text glyphs on page init. Caching now won't overflow the dispatch queues anymore if A LOT of pages are loaded at the same time.
*  PSPDFWord now has a lineBreaker property to detect line changes.
*  PSPDFPageInfo now regenerates the pageRotationTransform when the pageRotation is changed manually.
*  PSPDFKit now checks if a URL can be handled by the system and weird/nonrecognizable URLS no longer open the "Leave Appliction" alert.
*  The PSPDFAnnotationBarButtonItem is now smart enough to choose the right animation depending if the toolbar is at the top/bottom (slide in/out from top/bottom)
*  Setting the UIPopoverController no longer removes preexisting passthroughViews.
*  The renderQueue now no longer renders the requested image if the delegate has been released in the mean time. (The delegate is now weak instead of strong)
*  UI: Undo/Redo buttons on the drawing toolbar are better placed on iPhone.
*  UI: The color selection button is now smaller on iPhone/Landscape.
*  API: PSPDFPageInfo is not calculated in PSPDFDocumentProvider. If you've overridden methods that affect PSPDFPageInfo in PSPDFDocument, you should move that code to a PSPDFDocumentProvider subclass.
*  API: "realPage" has been renamed to "page" and is now set-able. The old "page" has been renamed to "screenPage". This finally cleans up the confusion that has been around page and realPage. In 99% of all cases, you're just interested in page and can ignore screenPage. Please update your bindings accordingly. If you formerly did KVO on realPage, change this to page too. (There's a deprecated compatibility property for realPage, but not for the KVO event)
*  API: additionalRightBarButtonItems has been renamed to additionalBarButtonItems.
*  API: pageScrolling has been renamed to scrollDirection. A deprecated compatibility call has been added.
*  API: handleTouchUpForAnnotationIgnoredByDelegate has been moved to PSPDFAnnotationController.
*  API: pdfViewController has been renamed to pdfController on PSPDFTabbedViewController.
*  API: Warning! If you've used pspdf_dispatch_sync_reentrant in your own code, you now absolutely must create your dispatch queues with pspdf_dispatch_queue_create. Apple has deprecated dispatch_get_current_queue(), so we're now using a different solution. This will most likely affect you if you're using the "Kiosk" sample code of PSPDFCatalog.
*  Titanium: The pdfView now has a hidePopover(true) method so PSPDF popovers can better be coordinated with appcelerator code popovers.
*  Fixes the lag introduced in 2.3.x when tapping on the screen and the textParser hasn't been finished yet.
*  Fixes a potential crash when the view was removed on PSPDFKit Basic Titanium.

*  Fixes an issue where PSPDFTabbedViewController did not properly align the tab bars in fullscreen mode.
*  Fixes an issue with creating PSPDFShapeAnnotation in code.
*  Fixes an issue where the isEditable flag on a PSPDFAnnotation was not honored when dragging note annotations.
*  Fixes an issue where the page could disappear on strong scrolling in pageCurl mode under iOS6.
*  Fixes an issue where scrolling on the tab bar (PSPDFTabbedViewController) sometimes didn't work.
*  Fixes an issue where the color picker was not properly displayed on bottom UIToolbars.
*  Fixes an UI issue where the selection and drawing of annotations on rotated pages was handled incorrectly.
*  Fixes an UI issue where the tabbed controller tabs could be mis-placed when rotating without visible HUD.
*  Fixes an UI issue where the thumbnails could slightly overlap the toolbar if the statusbar is transparent/auto-hiding.
*  Fixes several conditions where the PSPDFViewController could be deallocated on a background thread.
*  Fixes new warnings that popped up with Xcode 4.6. (pretty much all false positives)

__v2.3.3 - 18/October/2012__

Note: This will be the last release that supports iOS 4.3*. The next version will be iOS 5+ only and will require Xcode 4.5+ (iOS SDK 6.0) If you're having any comments on this, I would love to hear from you: pspdfkit@petersteinberger.com
The binary variant is already links with SDK 6.0 and will not link with 5.1 anymore. (It still works down to iOS 4.3 though)

(*) There is no device that supports iOS 4.3 and can't be upgraded to iOS5, and PSPDFKit already dropped iOS4.2 and with it armv6 in 2.0.

*  PSPDFShapeAnnotation and PSPDFLineAnnotation can now be created programmatically.
*  New flag: kPSPDFLowMemoryMode that combines a lot of settings to ease memory pressure for complex apps.
*  Annotations now have a new flag: controls:false to hide browser/movie controls. If videos have controls disabled, they can be controled via gestures. (tap=pause, pinch=full screen)
*  Text loupe now also moves if it's not anchored on a PSPDFPageView. (fixes stuck loupe issue)
*  Fixes a regression on view point restoration that could restore the view point at a different position.
*  Fixes an issue where the annotation toolbar could lock up rotation even after being dismissed.
*  Fixes an issue where bookmarks were checked for pages that were not visible.
*  Fixes the needless log statement "Password couldn't be converted to ASCII: (null)".
*  Fixes a text loupe regression where the loupe was not rotated on modal controllers.
*  Fixes a issue where in rare cases the document label (default displayed on iPhone only) was offset by a few pixels.

__v2.3.2 - 17/October/2012__

*  The text loupe is now displayed above all other contents (navigation bar, status bar, …)
*  New status bar style: PSPDFStatusBarSmartBlackHideOnIpad, which now is also the new default (changed from PSPDFStatusBarSmartBlack). Will hide the HUD AND the statusbar on tap now both on iPhone and on iPad.
*  Improves Website->PDF conversion. Now supports Websites, Pages, Keynote, Excel, Word, RTF, TXT, JPG, etc... (see PSPDFProcessor. This is a PSPDFKit Annotate feature)
*  PSPDFKit now uses the MediaBox everywhere. Previously the CropBox was used for rendering, which can display areas that are only intended for printing. See http://www.prepressure.com/pdf/basics/page_boxes.
*  New additionalActionsButtonItem allows to mark where the additional actions menu should be placed on the toolbar. (Default is left next to the last rightBarButtonItem)
*  New initializer in PSPDFDocument that makes handling with single-file multiple-page documents much easier. (PDFDocumentWithBaseURL:fileTemplate:startPage:endPage:)
*  Add support for GoToR link annotations.
*  Add method to search for a specific page label. See PSCGoToPageButtonItem in PSPDFCatalog for an example how to use it. (DevelopersGuide.pdf has labels)
*  The page popover now shows the page label if one is set in the PDF (e.g. to replace numbers with roman numbering)
*  Links to the external applications (e.g. AppStore, Mail) are now detected and a alert view is displayed asking to open the application or not.
*  Add workaround for a UIKit issue in iOS5.x that would sometimes dismiss the keyboard when removing characters from the search view controller. (Issues has been fixed in iOS6)
*  Fixes a UI issue in search results. If a search result was found more than one time in a string, the first occurence was marked bold. Now the actual result is marked bold.
   (This was mostly noticable when searching for very small words)
*  Fixes a issue where too fast drawing could result in some lines now being displayed.
*  Fixes isLastPage/isFirstPage methods for landscape mode.
*  Fixes a issue where sometimes overrideClassNames for annotation was ignored.

*  New scrolling mode: PSPDFPageScrollContinuousTransition (similar to UIWebView's default mode)
*  Support text selection on rotated PDF documents.
*  UIPopoverController is now styleable with a tintColor. This is enabled by default if tintColor is set. Use .shouldTintPopovers to disable this.
   As long as you use presentViewControllerModalOrPopover:embeddedInNavigationController:withCloseButton:animated:sender:options: your custom popovers will be styled the same way.
*  Adds support for adding annotations for double page mode on the right page. (Note: drawing still isn't perfect)

__v2.1.0 - 17/September/2012__

*  New: PSPDFAESCryptoDataProvider. Allows fast, secure on-the-fly decryption of AES256-secured PDF documents. (PSPDFKit Annotate feature)
   Unlike NSData-based solutons, the PDF never is *fully* decrypted, and this even works with very large (> 100MB) documents.
   Uses 50.000 PBKDF iterations and a custom IV vector for maximum security.
   Includes the AESCryptor helper Mac app to properly encrypt your PDF documents.
*  Allow to customize caching strategy per document with the new cacheStrategy property.
   This is automatically set to PSPDFCacheNothing when using PSPDFAESCryptoDataProvider.
*  Annotations now have a blue selection view when they are selected.
*  Add Black and Red to general annotation color options.
*  Font name/size for FreeText annotations is now parsed.
*  Added write support for FreeText annotations.
*  Allow to show/edit the associated text of highlight annotations.
*  Improves extensibility of the annotation system with adding a isOverlay method to PSPDFAnnotation.
   (Instead of hard-coding this to Link and Note annotations)
*  Moves the clipsToBounds call in PSPDFPageView so that delegate can change this (of UIView <PSPDFAnnotationView>).
*  Adds static helper [PSPDFTextSelectionView isTextSelectionFeatureAvailable] to make runtime checks between PSPDFKit and PSPDFKit Annotate.
*  Adds new isWriteable static method to PSPDFAnnotation subclasses to determine what classes can be written back to PDF.
*  Add kPSPDFAllowAntiAliasing as optional render option.
*  PSPDFOpenInBarButtonItem no longer performs a check for compatible apps. Checking this is pretty slow. An info alert will be displayed to the user if no compatible apps are installed (which is highly unlikely for PDF). You can restore the original behavior with setting kPSPDFCheckIfCompatibleAppsAreInstalled to YES.
*  The viewState is now preserved when another controller is displayed/dismissed modally. This mostly happend with showing/hiding the inline browser or the note text controller on an iPhone. After that the zoom rate was reset; this is now properly preserved.
*  The annotation toolbar now flashes if the user tries to hide the HUD while the bar is still active (and blocking that)
*  Various performance optimizations; especially scrolling and initial controller creation.
*  Removes sporadic vertical transition of the navigationController's navigationBar when HUD faded out.
*  Fixes "Persistent Text Loupe" when moving over a link annotation while selecting.
*  Fixes a memory leak when CGDataProviderRef is used to initialize a PSPDFDocument.
*  Fixes a issue where the UI could sometimes freeze for a while waiting for background tasks in low-memory situations.
*  Fixes a issue where the popover page display wasn't hidden after a rotation.
*  Fixes a issue where sometimes the page was not correctly restored after rotation (was +1).
*  Fixes a issue where, if email wasn't configured on the device, the internal web browser would be launched with a mailto: link. Now a alert is displayed.
*  Fixes a issue where a page could, under certain rare conditions, escape the page tracking and be "sticky" behind the new managed page views.
*  Titanium: Add saveAnnotation method to manually save annotations (needed for createView, automatically called in showPDFAnimated).
*  Titanium: Limit usage of useParentNavigationBar to iOS5 and above.
*  Titanium: fixes a rare condition where using document.password to unlock sometimes resulted in an incorrect value for isLocked.

__v2.0.3 - 14/September/2012__

*  Add a new "renderOptions" property to PSPDFDocument to fine-tune documents (e.g. fixes gray border lines in mostly-black documents)
*  Reduces file size of PSPDFKit.bundle by about 50%; improves speed of certain helper plists parsing.
*  Fixes potential category clashing
*  Fixes a bug that sneeked in because PSPDFKit is now compiled with Xcode 4.5. This release now also works with 4.4 for binary.

__v2.0.2 - 13/September/2012__

*  Support for iPhone 5, Xcode 4.5, armv7s and the new screen resolution.
*  Supports a new cover property to have a custom cover screen for videos (big play button; custom preview-images)
*  Don't show browse popover/actionsheet for multimedia extensions during a long press.
*  Don't allow long-press over a UIControl. (e.g. a UIButton)
*  Fixes a issue where soemtimes multimedia annotations would be added multiple times to the document.
*  Fixes a issue where sometimes you get blank space instead of a page when PSPDFPageRenderingModeFullPageBlocking and PSPDFPageScrollPerPageTransition was combined and the scrobble bar used heavily. This is a workaround for a UIKit bug.
*  Removes libJPGTurbo; Apple's own implementation has gotten faster (especially in iOS6)

__v2.0.1 - 12/September/2012__

*  Faster search (document pattern detection if deplayed until needed, outline results get cached)
*  Improved reaction time for complex PDF documents (e.g. annotations are only evaluated if they're already loaded; but won't lock the main thread due to lazy parsing)
*  Add additional checks so that even incorrectly converted NSURL-paths (where description instead of path has been called) work.
*  Fixes a issue where annotations were not saved with multiple-file documents on all but the first file.
*  Fixes problems where link annotations lost their page/link target after saving annotations into a file.
*  Fixes a problem where fittingWidth was always overridden when run on the iPhone.
*  Fixes a race condition in the new render stack that could lead to an assert in debug mode (non-critical)
*  Fixes the toolbar overlapping text issue in the PSPDFCatalog Kiosk Example; added comments how to work around that UIKit bug.
*  Made the pageRotation property of PSPDFPageInfo writeable; useful for manually rotation PDF documents.
*  Fixes some issues with the Titanium module; adds support for NavigationGroups.
*  Improved memory usage, especially on iPad1.

__v2.0.0 - 08/September/2012__

PSPDFKit v2 is a major updates with lots of changes and a streamlined API.
There are some API deprecations and some breaking changes; but those are fairly straightforward and well documented.

You need at least Xcode 4.4.1 to compile. (Xcode 4.4/4.5 both run fine on Lion, Mountain Lion is not needed but recommended)
PSPDFKit v2 is compatible with iOS 4.3 upwards. (armv7, i386 - thus dropping iOS 4.2/armv6 from v1)

The installation has been simplified. You now just drop the "PSPDFKit.embeddedframework" container into your project.
Next, enable the PSPDFKit.xcconfig project configuration. Here's a screenshot: http://cl.ly/image/1e1I2Z2e1D3F
(Select your project (top left), select project again in the PROJECT/TARGETS tree, select Info, then change in "Based on Configuration file" from None to PSPDFKit.)

If you have the sources and embedd PSPDFKit as a subproject, don't forget to also add PSPDFKit.bundle.


MAJOR NEW FEATURES:
*  Text selection! (PSPDFKit Annotate) (Includes Copy, Dictionary, Wikipedia support)
*  Annotations! (PSPDFKit Annotate) Highlight, Underscore, Strikeout, Note, Draw etc. Annotations also will be written back into the PDF.
   There is a new annptationBarButtonItem that shows the new annotation toolbar.
*  Smart Zoom (Text blocks are detected and zoomed onto on a double-tap; much like Safari)
   The PDF is now also dynamically re-rendered at *every* zoom level for maximal sharpness and quality.
*  Customizable render modes (enable/disable use of upscaled thumbnails). PSPDFPageRenderingModeFullPageBlocking is great for magazines.
*  Greatly improved Search. Faster, parses more font styles, compatible with international characters (chinese, turkish, arabic, ...)
*  Site Bookmarks (see bookmarksBarButtonItem and PSPDFBookmarkParser)
*  Support for VoiceOver accessibility (yes, even within the PDF!)

Further, PSPDFKit has been improved in virtually every area and a lot of details have been tweaked.

*  Inline password view. (Before, just a empty screen was shown when document wasn't unlocked.)
*  Adobe DRM detection (They are just marked as not viewable, instead of showing garbage)
*  PDF rendering indicator. (see pdfController.renderAnimationEnabled)
*  Even better view reuse. PSPDFPageView is now reused, scrolling is even smoother.
*  PSPDFDocument can now be initialized with a CGDataProviderRef or a dataArray.
*  The search/outline controllers now dynamically update their size based on the content height.
*  The Table of Contents/Outline controller now shows titles in multiple lines if too long (this is customizable)
*  Support for Table Of Contents (Outline) linking to external PDF documents.
*  Page Content/Background Color/Inversion can now be changed to modify rendering.
*  On the iPhone, a new documentLabel shows the title. (the navigationBar is too small for this)
*  PSPDFScrobbleBar now uses the small height style on iPhone/Landscape.
*  PSPDFViewController can now programatically invoke a search via searchForString:animated:.
*  PSPDFViewController now has a margin and a padding property to add custom margin/padding on the pdf view.
*  PSPDFViewController now has a HUDViewMode property to fine-tune the HUD.
*  PSPDFTabbedViewController now has a minTabWidth property (defaults to 100)
*  It's now possible to pre-supply even fully-rendered page images. PSPDFDocument's thumbnailPathForPage has been replaced with cachedImageURLForPage:andSize:.
*  PSPDFDocument now has a overrideClassNames dictionary, much like PSPDFViewController.
*  PSPDFDocument now has objectsAtPDFPoint/objectsAtPDFRect to return found glyphs and words.
*  PSPDFDocument now has convenience methods to render PDF content. (renderImageForPage:withSize:.../renderPage:inContext:...)
*  PSPDFDocument now exposes some more common metadata keys for the PDF metadata.
*  PSPDFDocument now has convenience methods to add and get annotations (addAnnotations:forPage:)
*  PSPDFDocument now has a property called annotationSaveMode to switch between PDF annotation embedding or an external file.
*  Support for documents with multiple sources(files/dataArray/documentProvider) is now greatly improved due to the new PSPDFDocument/PSPDFDocumentProvider structure.
*  PSPDFPageView now has convenience methods to calculate between PDF and screen coordinate space (convertViewPointToPDFPoint/convertPDFPointToViewPoint/etc)
*  PSPDFPageView no longer uses CATiledLayer; this has been replaced by a much faster and better custom solution.
*  PSPDFScrollView no longer accepts a tripple-tap for zooming out; this was a rarely-used feature in iOS and it increased the reaction time for the much more used double tap.
   Zooming in/out is now smarter (smart zoom) and does the right thing depending on the zoom position.
*  PSPDFWebViewController now supports printing.
*  A long-press on a PDF link annotation now shows the URL/Document/Page target in a popover.
*  When switching between DEMO/FULL; the change is automatically detected and the cache cleared. (No more watermark problems)
*  The image annotation view now properly displays and animates animated GIFs.
*  GMGridView has been replaced by the new and better PSCollectionView, which is a API compatible copy of UICollectionView.
*  Internal modernization; literals, subscripting, NS_ENUM, NS_OPTIONS.
*  Better internal error handling; more functions have error parameters.

Fixes/API changes:

*  The navigationBar title is no longer set on every page change.
*  PSPDFDocument's PDFDocumentWithUrl has been renamed to PDFDocumentWithURL.
*  Delegates are now called correctly (only once instead of multiple times) in pageCurl mode.
*  pdfViewController:willShowController:embeddedInController:animated: has been changed to (BOOL)pdfViewController:*SHOULD*ShowController:embeddedInController:animated:
*  tabbedPDFController:willChangeDocuments has been renamed to tabbedPDFController:shouldChangeDocuments.
*  New delegate: - (void)pdfViewController:(PSPDFViewController *)pdfController didEndPageDragging:(UIScrollView *)scrollView willDecelerate:(BOOL)decelerate withVelocity:(CGPoint)velocity targetContentOffset:(inout CGPoint *)targetContentOffset -> completes dragging delegates; zooming delegates were already available in PSPDFKit v1.
*  Changed willShowController... delegate to shouldShowController... that returns a BOOL.
*  Fixes a problem in the annotation parser where some named page links failed to resolve properly.
*  Fixes a problem where the Cancel button of the additionalBarButtonItem menu wasn't fully touch-able on iPhone.
*  Fixes a problem with PSPDFBarButtonItem image updating.
*  Lots of other minor and major changes.

__v1.10.0 - 25/May/2012__

This will probably be the last major release in the 1.x branch.
Work on 2.x is already underway, with a focus on text selection and annotations.

This release has some API-breaking changes:

* New toolbar handling (breaking API change)
  The properties searchEnabled, outlineEnabled, printEnabled, openInEnabled, viewModeControlVisible
  have been replaced by a much more flexible system based on the PSPDFBarButtonItem class.

  For example, to add those features under the "action" icon as a menu, use this:
  self.additionalRightBarButtonItems = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:self.printButtonItem, self.openInButtonItem, self.emailButtonItem, nil];
  If you're looking to e.g. remove the search feature, set a new rightBarButtonItems array that excludes the searchButtonItem.

  Likewise, the functions additionalLeftToolbarButtons, magazineButton and toolbarBackButton have been unified to self.leftBarButtonItems.
  If you want to replace the default closeButton with your own, just create your own UIBarButtonItem
  and set it to self.leftBarButtonItems = [NSArray arrayWithObject:customCloseBarButtonItem];

* Resolving pdf link paths has changed. (breaking API change)
  Previously, if no marker like "Documents" or "Bundle" was found, we resolved to the bundle.
  This version changes resolving the link to the actual position of the pdf file.
  If you need the old behavior, you can set PSPDFResolvePathNamesEnableLegacyBehavior to YES or use a custom subclass of the PSPDFAnnotationParser.

*  New class PSPDFTabbedViewController, to show multiple PSPDFDocuments with a top tab bar. iOS5 only. (includes new TabbedExample)
*  New feature: PDF page labels are parsed. (e.g. roman letters or custom names; displayed in the PSPDFPositionView and the thumbnail label)
*  New feature: send via Email: allows sending the pdf as an attachment. (see emailButtonItem in PSPDFViewController)
*  New feature: PSPDFViewState allows persisting/restoring of a certain document position (including page, position, zoom level).
   See documentViewState and restoreDocumentViewState:animated: in PSPDFViewController.
*  Add support for puny code characters in pdf URLs (like http://➡.ws/鞰齒). This uses the IDNSDK.
*  New property: useParentNavigationBar, if you embed the PSPDFViewController using iOS5 containment and still want to populate the navigationBar.
*  New property: pageCurlDirectionLeftToRight to allow a backwards pagination. (for LTR oriented documents)
*  New delegate: delegateDidEndZooming:atScale to detect user/animated zooming.
*  UI Improvement: Show URL in embedded browser title bar, until page is loaded with the real title.
*  General: Add french localization in PSPDFKit.bundle.
*  Core: PSPDFDocument now implements NSCopying and NSCoding protocols.
*  Fixes a problem where links with hash bangs (like https://twitter.com/#!/) where incorrectly escaped.
*  Fixes opening certain password protected files.
*  Fixes unlockWithPassword always returning YES, even with an incorrect password.
*  Fixes a crash regarding pageCurl and UpsideDown orientation on the iPhone.
*  Fixes a problem where the search delegates where called after canceling the operation.
*  Fixes a problem where the page wasn't re-rendered if it was changed while zoom was active.
*  Fixes a problem where the tile wasn't updated after setting document to nil.
*  Fixes a problem where under rare conditions a spinlock wasn't released in PSPDFGlobalLock.
*  Adds support for Xcode 4.4 DP4. Due to an already acknowledged Apple linker bug. Xcode 4.4 DP5 is currently broken. (Xcode 4.3.2 is still recommended)
*  Titanium: New min SDK is 2.0.1.GA2.

__v1.9.15 - 20/Apr/2012__

*  New delegate: pdfViewController:didEndPageScrollingAnimation: to detect if a scroll animation has been finished.
   This will only be called if scrollToPage:animated: is used with animated:YES. (not for manual user scrolling)
*  Additional safeguards have been put in place so that videos don't start playing in the background while scrolling quickly.

__v1.9.14 - 20/Apr/2012__

*  Adds support for Xcode 4.4 DP3.
*  Show document back button even if PSPDFViewController is embedded in a childViewController.
*  Doesn't try to restore the navigation bar if we're the only view on the navigation stack.
*  Allow PSPDFSearchHighlightView to be compatible with overrideClassNames-subclassing.
*  Works around some broken annotations that don't have "http" as protocol listed (just www.google.com)
*  PSPDFPageView now has convertViewPointToPDFPoint / convertPDFPointToViewPoint for easier annotation calculation.
*  There are also some new PSPDFConvert* methods in PSPDFKitGlobal that replace the PSPDFTiledView+ categories. (API change)
*  YouTube embeds finally support the autostart option. (Note: This might be flaky on very slow connections)

*  PDF cache generation is no no longer stopped in the viewWillDisappear event (only on dealloc, or when document is changed)
*  Titanium: Add ability to hide the close button.

Note: For pageCurl, Apple's UIPageViewController is used. This class is pretty new and still buggy.
I had to apply some private API fixes to make it work. Those calls are obfuscated and AppStore-safe.

If you have any reasons to absolutely don't use those workarounds, you can add
_PSPDFKIT_DONT_USE_OBFUSCATED_PRIVATE_API_ in the preprocessor defines.  (only in the source code variant)
This will also disable the pageCurl feature as the controller will crash pretty fast when my patches are not applied.

Don't worry about this, I have several apps in the store that use such workarounds where needed, it never was a problem.
Also, I reported those bugs to Apple and will keep track of the fixes,
and remove my workarounds for newer iOS versions if they fix the problem.


__v1.8.4 - 27/Dec/2011__

*  Fixes a problem where search highlights were not displayed.
*  Updated git version scripts to better work with branches. (git rev-list instead of git log)

*  Fallback to pdf filename if pdf title is set but empty.
*  pageMode can now be set while willAnimateRotationToInterfaceOrientation to customize single/double side switching.
*  Fixes a problem with the document disappearing in certain low memory situations.

__v1.8.2 - 25/Dec/2011__

*  Uses better image pre-caching code; now optimizes for RGB screen alignment; smoother scrolling!
*  Fixes a regression with scrobble bar hiding after animation.
*  Fixes wrong toolbar offset calculation on iPad in landscape mode.
*  Various performance optimizations regarding CGPDFDocument, HUD updates, thumbnails, cache creation.
*  Lazy loading of thumbnails.

__v1.8.1 - 23/Dec/2011__

*  UINavigationBar style is now restored when PSPDFViewController is popped back.
*  Annotation page cache is reset when protocol is changed.
*  Fixes Xcode Archive problem because of public header files in PSPDFKit-lib.xcodeproj
*  Fixes a regression with the Web-AlertView-action not working.

__v1.8.0 - 21/Dec/2011__

*  Search Highlighting! This feature is still in BETA, but already works with many documents. If it doesn't work for you, you can disable it with changing the searchMode-property in PSPDFDocumentSearcher. We're working hard to improve this, it just will take some more time until it works on every document. As a bonus, search is now fully async and no longer blocks the main thread.

*  ARC! PSPDFKit now internally uses ARC, which gives a nice performance boost and makes the codebase a lot cleaner. PSPDFKit is still fully compatible with iOS4 upwards. You need to manually include libarclite.so if you are not using ARC and need compatibility with iOS4. Check the MinimalExample.xcodeproj to see how it's done. (You can drag the two libarclite-libraries directly in your project). If you use the PSPDFKit-lib.xcodeproj as a submodule, you don't have to think about this, Xcode is clever enough to not expose this bug here. See more about this at http://pspdfkit.com/documentation.html.

*  New default shadow for pages. More square, iBooks-like. The previous shadow is available when changing shadowStyle in PSPDFScrollView. The shadow override function has been renamed to pathShadowForView.
*  New: PSPDFDocument now uses the title set in the pdf as default. Use setTitle to set your own title. Title is now also thread-safe.
*  New Thumbnail-Framework (removed AQGridView). Faster, better animations, allows more options. Thumbnails are now centered. You can override this behavior with subclassing gridView in PSPDFViewController.
*  New: HUD-elements are now within hudView, hudView is now a PSPDFHUDView, lazily created.
*  New: Page position is now displayed like in iBooks at the bottom page (title is now just title)
*  Changed: Videos don't auto play per default. Change the url to pspdfkit[autoplay:true]://devimages.apple.com/iphone/samples/bipbop/bipbopall.m3u8 to restore the old behavior (or use delegates).
*  Changed: viewMode does not longer animate per default. Use the new setViewMode:animated: to change it with animation.
*  Changed: the left section of the toolbar now uses iOS5-style leftToolBarButtons if available; falls back to custom UIToolBar in iOS4.
*  Shortly pressed link targets are now highlighted with a minimum duration.
*  Alert is no longer displayed for URLs that can't be opened by the system.
*  Support detection of "m4v" as video annotation.
*  Improves performance when caching very large documents.
*  Expose the borderColor of PSPDFLinkAnnotationView; set in one of the delegates.
*  Removes a lot of glue code and switches to KVO for many view-related classes (Scrobble Bar)
*  Add methods to check if PSPDFPageInfo is already available, improves thumbnail speed.
*  Add generic support to override classes. See the property "overrideClassNames" for details. This replaces "scrollViewClass" and "scrobbleBarClass" and is much more flexible. Just use a key/value pair of NSStrings with default/new class names and your custom subclass will be loaded.
*  setScrobbleBarEnabled is now animatable.
*  The protocolString for the multimedia link annotation additions can now be set in PSPDFAnnotationParser (defaults to pspdfkit://).
*  didTapOnPage is now didTapOnPageView, the former is deprecated.
*  PSPDFPageCoordinates now show a nice description when printed.
*  Many deprecated delegate calls have been removed. Check your calls.
*  Version number is now directly written from the git repository. (PSPDFVersionString() is now more accurate)
*  When a link annotation is tapped, the HUD no longer shows/hides itself.
*  HUD show/hide is now instant, as soon as scrolling is started. No more delays.
*  Scrollbar is now only changed if controller is displayed in full-screen (non-embedded).
*  Fixes a issue where PSPDFKit would never release an object if annotations were disabled.
*  Fixes a bug where the outline was calculated too often.
*  Fixes an issue where the title was re-set when changing the file of a pdf.
*  Fixes problems with syntax highlighting of some files. Xcode 4.3 works even better; use the beta if you can.
*  Fixes a bug with video player when auto play is not enabled.
*  Fixes encoding for mailto: URL handler (%20 spaces and other encoded characters are now properly decoded)
*  Fixes potential crash with recursive calls to scrollViewDidScroll.
*  Fixes a rare crash when delegates are changed while being enumerated.
*  Lots of other small improvements.

__v1.7.5 - 01/Dec/2011__

__v1.7.2 - 29/Nov/2011__

*  Changes delegates to return PSPDFView instead of the page: didShowPageView, didRenderPageView.
*  Improve zoom sharpness. (kPSPDFKitZoomLevels is now set to 5 per default from 4; set back if you experience any memory problems on really big documents.)
*  Increase tiling size on iPad1/older devices to render faster.
*  Reduce loading of unneeded pages. Previously happened sometimes after fast scrolling. This also helps when working with delegates.
*  Fixes a locking race condition when using PSPDFDocument.twoStepRenderingEnabled.

__v1.7.1 - 29/Nov/2011__

*  Fixes a rare crash when encountering non-standardized elements while parsing the Table of Contents.

__v1.7.0 - 28/Nov/2011__

*  PSPDFKit now needs at least Xcode 4.2/Clang 3.0 to compile.
*  Following new frameworks are required: libz.dylib, ImageIO.framework, CoreMedia.framework, MediaPlayer.framework, AVFoundation.framework.
*  Images are now compressed with JPG. (which is usually faster) If you upgrade, add an initial call to [[PSPDFCache sharedPSPDFCache] clearCache] to remove the png cache. You can control this new behavior or switch back to PNGs with PSPDFCache's useJPGFormat property.
*  Optionally, when using PNG as cache format, crushing can be enabled, which is slower at writing, but faster at reading later on. (usually a good idea!)

*  New multimedia features! Video can now be easily embedded with a custom pspdfkit:// url in link annotations. Those can be created with Mac Preview.app or Adobe Acrobat. Try for example "pspdfkit://devimages.apple.com/iphone/samples/bipbop/bipbopall.m3u8" to get the HTTP Live streaming test video.

*  Link annotations are now UIButtons. This allows more interactivity (feedback on touch down), and also changes the default implementation of PSPDFDocument's drawAnnotations function to be empty. Clear the cache after updating, or else you get two borders. You can also return to the old behavior if you return NO on shouldDisplayAnnotation (PSPDFViewControllerDelegate) anytime an annotation of type PSPDFAnnotationTypeLink is sent.

*  Localization is now handled via the PSPDFKit.bundle. You can either change this, or use PSPDFSetLocalizationDictionary to add custom localization.

*  PSPDFLinkAnnotation is renamed to PSPDFAnnotation and adds a new helper function to get the annotation rect.
*  PSPDFPage is refactored to PSPDFPageView and is now the per-page container for a document page. The delegate methods have been changed to return the corresponding PSPDFPageView. Within PSPDFPageView, you can get the parent scrollview PSPDFScrollView.
*  PSPDFPageModeAutomatic is now more intelligent and only uses dual page mode if it actually improves reading (e.g. no more dual pages on a landscape-oriented document)
*  PSPDFKitExample: fixes delete-image positioning in long scroll lists.
*  new: use PSPDFPageInfo everywhere to allow custom rotation override. (- (PSPDFPageInfo *)pageInfoForPage:(NSUInteger)page pageRef:(CGPDFPageRef)pageRef)
*  new delegate options to allow dynamic annotation creation.
*  Better size calculation for the toolbar, allows changing titles to longer/shorter words and resizing automatically.
*  PSPDFDocument now uses the title of the pdf document (if available). You can override this with manually setting a title.
*  New option "scrollingEnabled" to be able to lock scrolling. (e.g. when remote controlling the pdf)
*  Improves speed on image pre-caching.
*  Improves documentation.
*  Fixes a rotation problem with the last magazine page.
*  Fixes a bug where scrollPage w/o animation didn't show the page until the user scrolled.
*  Fixes a potential crash when view was deallocated while popover was opened.
*  Fixes a deadlock with clearCache.

__v1.6.20 - 18/Nov/2011__

*  fixes possible cache-reload loop with page-preload if non-odd values are chosen.
*  fixes a memory leak (regression in 1.6.18)

__v1.6.19 - 16/Nov/2011__

*  further small rotation improvement.

__v1.6.18 - 16/Nov/2011__

*  New: Much, much improved rotation. Now smooth as butter. Enjoy!

__v1.6.17 - 12/Nov/2011__

*  In search results, "Site" was renamed to "Page" to be consistent with the toolbar. If you use custom localization, you have to rename the entry "Site %d" to "Page %d".
*  add API call to allow basic text extraction from the search module (magazine.documentSearcher)

__v1.6.16 - 12/Nov/2011__

*  fixes a bug with invalid caching entries when a deleted document is re-downloaded in the same application session (pages suddenly went black)
*  add a custom lib-project for PSPDFKit; it's now easier than ever to integrate it. Note: you really should use that one - I'll switch over to ARC soon, so a library makes things easier.

__v1.6.15 - 05/Nov/2011__

*  thumbnails are now displayed under the transparent bar, not overlapping
*  only enable outline if it's enabled and there actually is an outline (no more empty popovers)
*  mail links are now presented in a form sheet on the iPad
*  allow show/hide of navigation bar even when zoomed in

__v1.6.14 - 22/Oct/2011__

*  fixes bug where delete method of PSPDFCache (removeCacheForDocument) was deleting the whole directory of the pdf instead of just the related files

__v1.6.13 - 22/Oct/2011__

*  removed the zeroing weak reference helper. If you use custom delegates for PSPDFCache, you now need to manually deregister them. Upside: better management of delegates.

__v1.6.12 - 19/Oct/2011__

*  changed: turns out, when compiling with Xcode 4.2/Clang, you'll loose binary compatibility with objects linked from 4.1. Thus, the framework crashed with EXC_ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION when compiled within an older Xcode. I will use 4.1 some more time to give everyone the change to upgrade, but due to some *great* improvements in Clang 3.0 compiler that ships with Xcode 4.2 (e.g. nilling out of structs accessed from a nil object) it's highly advised that you use Xcode 4.2. If you use the source code directly, this is not an issue at all.

__v1.6.11 - 14/Oct/2011__

*  new: PSPDFKit is now compiled with Xcode 4.2/iOS Base SDK 5.0 (still works with 4.x)
*  improves compatibility for outline parser; now able to handle rare array/dict destination variants (fixes all destinations = page 1 error)
*  fixes a rare stack overflow when re-using zoomed scrollviews while scrolling.
*  fixes a compile problem on older Xcode versions. (It's not officially supported though - use Xcode 4.2 for the best experience!)
*  fixes a memory problem where iPad1 rarely tries to repaint a page forever

__v1.6.10 - 25/Sept/2011__

*  aspectRatioEqual now defaults to NO. Many customers oversee this and then send me (false) bug reports. Set this to YES for maximum speed if your document has one single aspect ratio (like most magazines should).
*  scroll to active page in grid view
*  fixes small offset-error in the scrobble bar

__v1.6.9 - 22/Sept/2011__

*  add option do debug memory usage (Instruments isn't always great)
*  improves memory efficiency on tile drawing, animations

*  update thumbnail grid when document is changed via property

__v1.6.7 - 15/Sept/2011__

*  improves outline parser, now handles even more pdf variants

__v1.6.6 - 15/Sept/2011__

*  potential bug fix for concurrent disk operations (NSFileManager is not thread safe!)
*  fixes positioning problem using the (unsupported) combination of PSPDFScrollingVertical and fitWidth

__v1.6.5 - 15/Sept/2011__

*  fixes a bug where scroll position was remembered between pages when using fitWidth

__v1.6.4 - 15/Sept/2011__

*  new: didRenderPage-delegate
*  fixes: crash bug with NaN when started in landscape

__v1.6.3 - 14/Sept/2011__

*  new: maximumZoomScale-property is exposed in PSPDFViewController
*  changed: *realPage* is now remembered, not the page used in the UIScrollView. This fixes some problems with wrong page numbers.
*  fixes situation where page was changed to wrong value after view disappeared, rotated, and reappeared.
*  fixes option button in example is now touchable again
*  fixes a bug where HUD was never displayed again when rotating while a popover controller was visible
*  fixes potential crash where frame get calculated to NaN, leading to a crash on view rotation
*  fixes problems when compiling with GCC. You really should use LLVM/Clang though.

__v1.6.2 - 13/Sept/2011__

*  fixed: HUD is now black again on disabled status bar

__v1.6.1 - 13/Sept/2011__

*  new: open email sheet per default when detecting mailto: annotation links. (You now need the MessageUI.framework!)
*  new: fileUrl property in PSPDFDocument
*  improve toolbar behavior when setting status bar to default
*  fixes memory related crash on older devices
*  fixes crash when toolbarBackButton is nil
*  greatly improved KioskExample


__v1.6.0 - 12/Sept/2011__

*  changed: willShowPage is now deprecated, use didShowPage. Both now change page when page is 51% visible. Former behavior was leftIndex

*  new: directionalLock is enabled for PSPDFScrollView. This is to better match iBooks and aid scrolling
*  new: kPSPDFKitZoomLevels is now a global setting. It's set to a sensible default, so editing is not advised.
