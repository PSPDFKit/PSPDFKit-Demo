Commercial Development License
------------------------------
The following license applies to software components purchased and paid for in full.

Copyright (c) 2010-2013, Peter Steinberger
All rights reserved.

The license your purchased, unless otherwise negotiated in writing, is valid for one explicit app ID, thus one iOS application.
If you are distributing your app via a custom distribution system (not Apple's public App Store), you need one license per distribution per company (e.g. Enterprise App Store), even if you're using the same app ID for those versions.

Redistribution and use of this software is permitted in binary form under the following conditions:

* The software must be distributed only as part of a larger original work by the licensee; verbatim redistribution of the software as licensed is prohibited.
* The software may only be distributed as a software application readily executable by end users on designated devices designed by Apple Inc. running the iOS operating system. Redistributing the software in re-linkable "library" form is explicitly prohibited.
* The software's binary object code must be statically linked to the application to form a single binary file.
* No source or header files may be redistributed.
* Neither the names PSPDFKit or Peter Steinberger, nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.
* The license has not been terminated by licensee.
* The licensee has separately licensed the required "iOS SDK" software from Apple Inc.

Redistribution and use of the software is permitted in binary and/or source form under the following conditions:
The recipient has purchased a separate, independent license for the software from Peter Steinberger. The redistributed software is governed by that license. Any modifications to the software by the licensee are to be marked clearly as such.

With purchasing this software you agree to allow Peter Steinberger or any future maintainer of PSPDFKit to list your company and company products that include PSPDFKit on our product website and related material. This is also valid if the license is purchased through a 3rd party. An additional fee can be paid if you do not want this endorsement.

Peter Steinberger reserves the right, in his sole discretion to modify this Agreement at any time. With downloading and integrating updated versions of PSPDFKit,  you agree to the respectively latest version of this Agreement. You shall be responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modification.

This software is provided by Peter Steinberger "as is" and any express or implied warranties, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose are disclaimed. In no event shall Peter Steinberger be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages (including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of sue, data or profits; or other business interruption) however caused and on any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of the use of this software, even if advised of the possibility of such damage. IN THE EVENT THAT ANY EXCLUSION CONTAINED IN THIS EULA SHALL BE HELD TO BE INVALID FOR ANY REASON AND THE COMPONENT PROVIDER BECOMES LIABLE FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT MAY LAWFULLY BE LIMITED, SUCH LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF THE PRICE PAID TO THE COMPONENT PROVIDER FOR THE COMPONENT AND EURO 20.

Unless the parties have entered into a written amendment to this agreement that is signed by both parties regarding PSPDFKit, this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Licensee and Peter Steinberger pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any and all written or oral agreements with respect to such subject matter.

This Agreement, and any disputes arising from or relating to the interpretation thereof, shall be governed by Austrian law.
If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. The failure of Peter Steinberger to act with respect to a breach of this Agreement by Licensee or others does not constitute a waiver and shall not limit Peter Steinberger rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches. This Agreement is personal to Licensee and may not be assigned or transferred for any reason whatsoever (including, without limitation, by operation of law, merger, reorganization, or as a result of an acquisition or change of control involving Licensee) without Peter Steinberger prior written consent and any action or conduct in violation of the foregoing shall be void and without effect. Peter Steinberger expressly reserves the right to assign this Agreement and to delegate any of its obligations hereunder.
