 (Optional) An array identifying which fields to reset or which to exclude from resetting, depending on the setting of the Include/ Exclude flag in the Flags entry (see Table 239). Each element of the array shall be either an indirect reference to a field dictionary or (PDF 1.3) a text string representing the fully qualified name of a field. Elements of both kinds may be mixed in the same array.
 If this entry is omitted, the Include/Exclude flag shall be ignored; all fields in the documentâ€™s interactive form are reset.
