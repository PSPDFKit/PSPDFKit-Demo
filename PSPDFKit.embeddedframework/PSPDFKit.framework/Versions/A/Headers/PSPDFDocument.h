/**
* The PSPDFDocument class represents a single logical document for the user.
* It can use multiple data sources (files, NSData, CGDataProvider) that are then merged together on display.
*
* Ensure that a PSPDFDocument is only opened by one PSPDFViewController at any time.
*
* You're expected to set any properties on a single thread only (usually the main thread)
* Changing properties once the document is visible will require calling reloadData on the controller most of the time.
*
* PSPDFDocument builds up some cache when properties like `pageCount` are first accessed.
* You want to create those objects once and keep them around, creating and destroying them on the fly is very wasteful.
* If you change the underlying files the PSPDFDocument points to, you need to clear it's internal cache.
*
* To speed up the first time the document is displayed in the PSPDFViewController, you can call fillCache on any thread.
