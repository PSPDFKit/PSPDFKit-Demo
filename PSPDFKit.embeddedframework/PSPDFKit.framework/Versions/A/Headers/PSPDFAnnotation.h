/**
 Defines a PDF annotation.

 PSPDFAnnotationManager searches the runtime for subclasses of PSPDFAnnotation and builds up a dictionary using supportedTypes.

 Don't directly make an instance of this class, use subclasses like PSPDFNoteAnnotations or PSPDFLinkAnnotations. This class will return nil if initialized directly, unless with the type PSPDFAnnotationTypeUndefined.

 Subclasses need to implement - (id)initWithAnnotationDictionary:(CGPDFDictionaryRef)annotationDictionary inAnnotsArray:(CGPDFArrayRef)annotsArray.

 Ensure that custom subclasses also correctly implement hash and isEqual.

 Annotation objects should only ever be edited on ONE thread. Modify properties on the main thread only if they are already active (for creation, it doesn't matter which thread creates them). Before rendering, obtain a copy of the annotation to ensure it's not mutated while properties are read.
