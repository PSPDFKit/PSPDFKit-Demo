/// This property customizes what tokenizer should be used. Defaults to the 'unicode61' tokenizer.
/// The UNICODE61 tokenizer allows searching inside text with diacritics. http://swwritings.com/post/2013-05-04-diacritics-and-fts
/// Sadly, Apple doesn't ship this tokenizer with their sqlite builds. PSPDFKit will detect custom versions of sqlite and use the 'unicode61' tokenizer whenever possible, falling back to the default ("simple") tokenizer if not. For the default tokenizer PSPDFKit will utilize CFStringTransform() to strip combining marks and improve searchability. This is slower and modifies the content, compared to the unicode61 tokenizer. If your content only contains English language, it might not make a difference what tokenizer you are using.
