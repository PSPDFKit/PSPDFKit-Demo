/**
 PDF FreeText Annotation.

 A free text annotation (PDF 1.3) displays text directly on the page. Unlike an ordinary text annotation (see 12.5.6.4, “Text Annotations”), a free text annotation has no open or closed state; instead of being displayed in a pop-up window, the text shall be always visible.

 @note fillColor is not supported for free text annotations. (at least not for PDF writing)
