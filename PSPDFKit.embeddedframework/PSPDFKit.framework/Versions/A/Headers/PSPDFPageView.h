/**
 In PSPDFKit, annotations are managed in two ways:

 1) Annotations that are fixed and rendered with the page image.
 Those annotations are PSPDFHighlightAnnotation, PSPDFShapeAnnotation, PSPDFInkAnnotation and more.
 Pretty much all more or less "static" annotations are handled this way.

 2) Then, there are the more dynamic annotations like PSPDFLinkAnnotation and PSPDFNoteAnnotation.
 Those annotations are not part of the rendered image but are actual subviews in PSPDFPageView.
 Those annotations return YES on the isOverlay property.

 Especially with PSPDFLinkAnnotation, the resulting views are - depending on the subtype - PSPDFVideoAnnotationView, PSPDFWebAnnotationView and much more. The classic PDF link is a PSPDFLinkAnnotationView.

 This method is called recursively with all annotation types except if they return isOverlay = NO.
