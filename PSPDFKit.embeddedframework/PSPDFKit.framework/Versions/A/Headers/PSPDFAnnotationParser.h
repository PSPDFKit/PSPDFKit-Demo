/**
 Parses and saves annotations for each page in a PDF.
 Supports many sources with the PSPDFAnnotationProvider protocol.

 Usually you want to add your custom PSPDFAnnotationProvider instead of subclassing this.
 If you subclass, use overrideClassNames in PSPDFDocument.

 This class will set the documentProvider on both annotation adding and retrieving. You don't have to handle this in your annotationProvider subclass.
