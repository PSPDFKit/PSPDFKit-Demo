Redistribution and use of this software is permitted in binary form under the following conditions:

* The software must be distributed only as part of a larger original work by the licensee; verbatim redistribution of the software as licensed is prohibited.
* The software may only be distributed as a software application readily executable by end users on designated devices designed by Apple Inc. running the iOS operating system. Redistributing the software in re-linkable "library" form is explicitly prohibited.
* The software's binary object code must be statically linked to the application to form a single binary file.
* No source or header files may be redistributed.
* Neither the names "PSPDFKit" or "Peter Steinberger", nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without Licensor's explicit prior written permission.

After termination of this Agreement, Licensee is obliged to remove PSPDFKit fully from his software development environment and to delete the corresponding files. Furthermore, Licensee is not permitted to grant any further sublicenses to his customers or to distribute software applications to which PSPDFKit is linked to or integrated in.

All costs involved in such activities shall be borne by Licensee. Licensee shall report any detected faults or defects of PSPDFKit to Licensor, in order to enable Licensor to remove such faults or defects in course of the provision of updates or of a further product development. 

Licensor or any future maintainer of PSPDFKit is permitted to list and disclose Licensee's name or company and those products of the Licensee including PSPDFKit on Licensor's product website and related material.
