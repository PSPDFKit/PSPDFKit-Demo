      <p style="color: red;">Heads Up: We'll update pricing starting 1/1/2013 to reflect <a href="https://github.com/PSPDFKit/PSPDFKit-Demo/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">all the new features</a> that went into v2 since the initial release.</p><br>

      <p>(*) If you are distributing your app via a custom distribution system (not Apple's public App Store), you need one license per distribution per company (e.g. Enterprise App Store), even if you're using the same app ID for those versions.</p><br>

      <p>Every package includes the PSPDFCatalog project <b>with lots of example code</b> to quick-start development.</p><br>

<p><b>One license is eligible for a single app bundle ID only. Additional licenses must be purchased for additional apps.</b><br>
(There's no difference whether you're deploying apps on the AppStore or using them In-House only)<br>
You'll get a 15% discount for each additional license after buying your first license. (<a href="mailto:pspdfkit@petersteinberger.com">Contact us to get a coupon code</a>)</p><br>
<p>There is also the option for further discounts if you are an OEM that needs many licenses. <a href="mailto:pspdfkit@petersteinberger.com">Contact us with your project requirements.</a></p>
	<br>
        <p>Before you purchase, be sure to <a href="http://github.com/PSPDFKit/PSPDFKit-Demo/zipball/master">try out the demo.</a></p>
        <p>If you have any questions, feel free to ask at <a href="mailto:pspdfkit@petersteinberger.com">pspdfkit@petersteinberger.com</a>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The Appcelerator Titanium Module is included in every package. <a href="https://github.com/Krumelur/MonoTouch-PSPDFKit-bindings">Looking for MonoTouch-Bindings instead?</a></p>

      <h2 class="section-title"><a href="https://github.com/PSPDFKit/PSPDFKit-Demo/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">All updates within PSPDFKit 2.x</a> are included.</h2>
      
      <p><b>Q: What is an explicit App ID?</b></p>
      <p>A: <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/ToolsLanguages/Conceptual/DevPortalGuide/CreatingandConfiguringAppIDs/CreatingandConfiguringAppIDs.html">An explicit app ID is a string used to specify exactly one app.</a></p><br>
      
      <p><b>Q: We sell our solution to different companies via the Enterprise App Store, do we need multiple licenses?</b></p>
      <p>A: Yes. Even if you use the same app ID, if you distribute the app in multiple Enterprise App Stores and/or apply different branding, you need to purchase one license per branded application. In Enterprise cases it's best to contact us for a special agreement.</a></p><br>
      
	<p><b>Q: We're offering a lite version and/or different versions for iPad and iPhone. Will we need multiple licenses?</b></p>
	<p>A: We make exceptions for certain use cases. Having a lite/full version is one of them - you're fine with one license. In case you make your app compatible both for iPhone and iPad and you're not using a universal app, it's still fine.</a></p><br>
	
	<p><b>Q: Will we need a separate license for beta versions / internal client demos?</b></p>
	<p>A: No. You can use the license you're already having to distribute beta versions, even if the beta uses a different bundle ID. Client demos are also fine, as long as they're really just a demo and not the finished product.</a></p><br>

      <p><b>Q: How can I upgrade from PSPDFKit v1?</b></p>
      <p>A: <a href="upgrading.html">You get 50% discount if you own a v1 license. Read the details here.</a></p><br>

	<p><b>Q: Will you provide support?</b></p>
	<p>A: Yes. We're highly interested in getting feedback/bugs/feature requests to further improve our framework. With your license purchase, you'll get free email support (within reason) and also all updates within PSPDFKit 2.x</p><br>
	
	<p><b>Q: Will PSPDFKit Annotate be enough? Do I need the source code?</b></p>
	<p>A: Almost every feature can be customized without changing the source code. In fact you really shouldn't change the PSPDFKit classes to allow an easy upgrade (and there are lots of updates). However, while your goal should be subclassing, the source code will help a great deal to understand how all parts are working together. If you're doing anything non-standard (like implementing a custom annotation backend), you should purchase the source code.</p><br>
	
	<p><b>Q: Can I use PSPDFKit with Enterprise apps?</b></p>
	<p>A: Yes. The same explicit app ID restrictions apply. If you're using PSPDFKit in the enterprise and need multiple licenses, you should <a href="mailto:pspdfkit@petersteinberger.com">contact us with your requirements.</a></p><br>
	
	<p><b>Q: Can you clarify on "Binary distribution is allowed within your app as long as it's statically linked in one binary."?</b></p>
	<p>A: This is just to ensure that you're not simply giving away the framework for free to download. If you integrate it into your app, Xcode will automatically statically link that to your final app binary. (There is a way to dynamically link on the Mac, and we wanted to be sure to protect our business, even if this at some point might also come to iOS)</p><br>
