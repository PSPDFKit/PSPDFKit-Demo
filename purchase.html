<p><b>* One license is eligible for a single app bundle ID only.

      <div class="columnleft">
	<p><b>Q: What's Premium Support?</b></p>
	<p>A: You get an email response usually within one day, and we try to work with you and fix your problem, most of the times by writing a new example that shows how to achieve X in the PSPDFCatalog section. This will save your developers tremendous time.
	One such example that has been written especially for a client was PSCSaveAsPDFViewController, to show how to implement "Save as..." with annotations. Another feature that was implemented was "Brightness" which started as an example specifically for a customer but later was so useful that it has been moved to core PSPDFKit. We also help with integration problems or bugs that only show up during integration with your application.</p><br>

	<p><b>Q: What's included in the precompiled binary? What's the difference between PSPDFKit Basic and PSPDFKit Viewer?</b></p>
	<p>A: The precompiled PSPDFKit.embeddedframework (armv7, armv7s, i386) for Enterprise, Complete and Basic includes the full PSPDFKit feature set (text selection, annotation creation/edit features and <a href='/documentation.html#encryption'>strong encryption</a>). PSPDFKit Viewer has no text selection, only readonly annotation support, no strong encryption and only a limited feature set for PDF creation. If you see methods marked with "PSPDFKit Annotate feature", they are not available in PSPDFKit Viewer.</p><br>
	
	<p><b>Q: Will we get the complete source code, or are there any binary only parts?</b></p>
	<p>A: There are no binary only parts. Full source code will give you all source files (about 400 well-documented source files with >60.000 LOC) and an Xcode project so you can use PSPDFKit as a submodule within your own project. Almost all code in PSPDFKit is developed by us with the exception of some minor 3rd party code additions, which are clearly marked as such and are licensed under very liberal MIT or BSD licenses. See <a href="https://github.com/PSPDFKit/PSPDFKit-Demo/blob/master/ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS">ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</a> for a detailed listing about 3rd party code.</p><br>
	
	<p><b>Q: What's the "GitHub access" On PSPDFKit Enterprise?</b></p>
	<p>A: With the enterprise version, you get full <a href="https://github.com/PSPDFKit/PSPDFKit-Demo">GitHub access</a> for the source code, which includes all the history all the way back to version 1.0. This is extremely valuable since you get a lot of additional (commit) information for every source code line. Access to GitHub is optional, please send an additional email if you want access. We will only add one developer account to the repository.</a></p><br>

      <p><b>Q: What is an explicit App ID?</b></p>
      <p>A: <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/ToolsLanguages/Conceptual/DevPortalGuide/CreatingandConfiguringAppIDs/CreatingandConfiguringAppIDs.html">An explicit app ID is a string used to specify exactly one app.</a></p><br>
      
      <p><b>Q: We require source code and need 3 licenses. Do we need to purchase PSPDFKit Complete three times?</b></p>
      <p>A: No. You only need one source code license for your company. For other products, you can use the binary license and your developers can still use the source version to look up specific implementation details.</a></p><br>
      
      <p><b>Q: We sell our solution to different companies via the Enterprise App Store, do we need multiple licenses?</b></p>
      <p>A: Yes. Even if you use the same app ID, if you distribute the app in multiple Enterprise App Stores and/or apply different branding, you need to purchase one license per branded application. In Enterprise cases it's best to contact us for a special agreement.</a></p><br>
      
	<p><b>Q: We're offering a lite version and/or different versions for iPad and iPhone. Will we need multiple licenses?</b></p>
	<p>A: We make exceptions for certain use cases. Having a lite/full version is one of them - you're fine with one license. In case you make your app compatible both for iPhone and iPad and you're not using a universal app, it's still fine.</a></p><br>
	
</div><div class="columnright">

	<p><b>Q: Will we need a separate license for beta versions / internal client demos?</b></p>
	<p>A: No. You can use the license you're already having to distribute beta versions, even if the beta uses a different bundle ID. Client demos are also fine, as long as they're really just a demo and not the finished product.</a></p><br>	

      <p><b>Q: How can I upgrade from PSPDFKit v1?</b></p>
      <p>A: <a href="upgrading.html">You get 50% discount if you own a v1 license. Read the details here.</a></p><br>
      
      <p><b>Q: Can we upgrade from option X to option Y?</b></p>
      <p>A: Yes. You simply pay the price difference. Keep in mind that this doesn't extend your one-year-updates cycle. (unless you're upgrading from Basic to complete, where 6 months of updates will be added). Contact us with your PET* purchase number and you'll get a code that allows you to upgrade.</p><br>
      
	<p><b>Q: Will you provide support?</b></p>
	<p>A: Yes. We're highly interested in getting feedback/bugs/feature requests to further improve our framework.</p><br>
	
	<p><b>Q: Do I need the source code?</b></p>
	<p>A: Almost every feature can be customized without changing the source code. In fact you really shouldn't change the PSPDFKit classes to allow an easy upgrade (and there are lots of updates). However, while your goal should be subclassing, the source code will help a great deal to understand how all parts are working together. If you're doing anything non-standard (like implementing a custom annotation backend), you should purchase PSPDFKit Complete or Enterprise.</p><br>
	
	<p><b>Q: Can I use PSPDFKit with Enterprise apps?</b></p>
	<p>A: Yes. The same explicit app ID restrictions apply. If you're using PSPDFKit in the enterprise and need multiple licenses, you should <a href="mailto:peter@pspdfkit.com">contact us with your requirements.</a></p><br>
	
	<p><b>Q: Our company policy forbids us from being listed as a customer.</b></p>
	<p>A: The license terms for PSPDFKit Enterprise are negotiable. <a href="mailto:peter@pspdfkit.com">Contact us for details.</a></p><br>
	
	<p><b>Q: Can you clarify on "Binary distribution is allowed within your app as long as it's statically linked in one binary."?</b></p>
	<p>A: This is just to ensure that you're not simply giving away the framework for free to download. If you integrate it into your app, Xcode will automatically statically link that to your final app binary. (There is a way to dynamically link on the Mac, and we wanted to be sure to protect our business, even if this at some point might also come to iOS)</p><br>	
	
	<p><b>Q: What's the Appcelerator Titanium Module?</b></p>
	<p>A: We offer a native to JavaScript bridge that works with Appcelerator Titanium. Appcelerator is a technology that allows rapid application development for companies that are more experience with JavaScript than ObjectiveC.</p><br>
	
	<p><b>Q: What's all supported in the Appcelerator Titanium bridge?</b></p>
	<p>A: PSPDFKit exposes only a subset of the features in the Titanium port. Enough to make a great app, probably not enough if your app requires heavy customization. However, you also get the Titanium Plugin Source Code with PSPDFKit Complete or Enterprise, so you can customize and extend the plugin bridge. Enterprise customers can also request smaller additions (for example 2.7 will add support for search from JavaScript in response to one company that required this feature)</p><br>
	
	<p><b>Q: We are using MonoTouch. Are you supporting this?</b></p>
	<p>A: The <a href="https://github.com/Krumelur/MonoTouch-PSPDFKit-bindings">MonoTouch Bindings</a> are community generated. We help where we can, but there might be delays between the time a new PSPDFKit version is released and the time the binding is updated.</p><br>
